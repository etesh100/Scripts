Fourth Draft
October 18, 1995
EXT ROAD - DAY

An old foreign CAR on its last legs winds its way down a sunny road deep in the Irish countryside -

ROLL CREDITS 

EXT CAR - DAY

Two older CHAR WOMEN are in the car, searching apprehensively for their destination - 

EXT ROAD - DAY

The car turns down a forbidding road - we follow the car as it makes its way down the winding,
wooded path - 

EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - DAY

The Victorian manor looms on the horizon in the hazy afternoon light - 

The car approaches and stops in front of the house - 

END CREDITS

The two women get out, surveying the dark building - the FIRST CHAR WOMAN opens the trunk,
removing a CARRYING TRAY of cleaning supplies - 

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		Welcome to Siberia.

The SECOND CHAR WOMAN takes some MOPS out of the back 
seat - 
				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		This is the last time I travel 
		so far for a job.  We won't get
		back till nightfall.

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		Well the pay is worth it.

The two approach the front door as the first char woman takes a KEY out of an ENVELOPE -

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		Not a bad place to live.  I
		wonder how much it cost.



				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		If you have to ask, you probably 
		can't afford it.

The first char woman looks at the second, then unlocks the front door - 

INT MANOR DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

The two women enter with their supplies - the house is furnished with dusty antiques - 

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		Looks like we have our work cut 
		out for us.

The second char woman heads toward the living room - 

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The second char woman enters and looks around - suddenly she is STARTLED by something that catches
her eye -

POV the FURNITURE is in disarray, chairs and tables on end, all in the center of the room - a
circle of BOOKS standing upright surrounds the furniture -

The first char woman approaches, sees the same thing - 

The women approach the furniture - 

				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		What's all this?

The first char woman shakes her head and heads out -  

The second char woman begins to pick up the books -

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		I'll start the upstairs.

The first char woman exits as the second one picks a chair up out of the pile - 




INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

The first char woman enters the bedroom and looks around, clearly impressed by the room and its
furnishings - she puts her cleaning supplies on the ground, and goes over to the window - 

She looks out the window for a beat, then opens the window to let in some fresh air - a breeze
blows in - the woman takes in the country scenery outside - 

Suddenly there is the faint sound of SCRATCHING - the char woman listens for a beat, then turns
around and gasps - 

A large black RAT faces her, staring up at her with black beady eyes - 

The char woman's expression turns from shock to concern - 

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		Oh Lord.

Repulsed by the rodent she stomps her foot, in hopes it will scare it away - the rat backs off - 

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

The char woman watches as the rat scurries away - 

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The second char woman continues to straighten up the living room, setting a chair in place in the
corner - 

She notices a small oval PAINTING on the wall a portrait of a WOMAN from the 1860's - the painting
stares back at her - 

The char woman then finishes putting the remaining furniture in the center of the room away -

INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

The char woman sprays window cleaner on the windows - 

She wipes the window with a paper towel, apparently preoccupied until she suddenly stops wiping
the window - 

Sensing something's presence, she slowly turns around and looks - 

The RAT has returned, and continues to look up at her - 

The char woman stares back at it with dread -

The woman looks around for a blunt object, settling on a POKER next to the FIREPLACE - 


The woman approaches with the poker - the rat does not 
budge - 

Hoping to avoid the unpleasant task, the woman stomps her foot - nothing happens - she stomps
harder - 

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The second char woman moves some books and listens to the banging upstairs, wondering what all the
commotion is - 

INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

The char woman continues to stare at the rat - she stomps her foot - the rat does not move - 

The woman raises the poker to strike the rodent  - it stares back at her - suddenly it RUNS toward
the woman - 

The woman screams and JOLTS backward, hitting an end table and falling to the ground - 

She kicks her legs furiously to avoid the rat when suddenly 

DOZENS OF RATS emerge from all parts of the room and ATTACK the char woman - she lets out a BLOOD
CURDLING SCREAM - 

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The second char woman spins around to hear the horrible screaming, and runs toward the stairs - 

INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

The char woman is COVERED by squealing rats as she furiously tries to fight them off, all the time
screaming at the top of her lungs - 

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

The second char woman runs down the hall with a panicked expression on her face - she approaches
the master bedroom - 

INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

The char woman continues to fight off the rats - they are everywhere, TAILS and CLAWED FEET and
BLACK EYES and TEETH that rip into her skin -

Soon the second char woman appears at the door and freezes in her tracks for a beat before running
into the room - 

She runs to embrace the first char woman curled up in a ball in the corner - there are NO RATS on
the 1st char woman but she HALLUCINATES that there are -  

The second char woman's presence only agitates the first char woman, who fights her off
frantically - 

				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		Kathleen!  For God's sake 
		what's wrong!

The first char woman springs to her feet, still screaming - 
The second char woman embraces her - 

				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		It's all right it's all right! 

The first char woman struggles to come to her senses and then begins to cry uncontrollably - 


				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		You're ok, everything's ok...what 
		happened?

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		There were rats...
			(crying)

				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		Rats?  There are no rats...shhhh...

The first char woman looks around the room - 

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		Rats everywhere...

The first char woman inspects her ankle which appears unharmed - 

				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		See?  Everything's ok...there aren't
		any rats.

The first char woman looks around the room, fighting to collect herself - 

				1ST CHAR WOMAN
		My God...I need some air...


				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		Ok ok...Jesus you nearly gave me 
		a - 

The first char woman then BOLTS out of the room - the second char woman watches her - 

				2ND CHAR WOMAN
		Kathleen!  Wait!

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

The first char woman runs down the hall - 

The second char woman comes out and watches her with a look of genuine concern on her face - 

INT FOYER - DAY

The first char woman yanks the door open and runs outside - 

INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

The second char woman looks around the room for a beat, then heads out into the hallway - 

INT FOYER/STAIRCASE - DAY

The second char woman heads down the stairs, notices the door is open, and starts to head in that
direction - Something then catches her attention that freezes her in her tracks - she looks on in
horror - 

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The furnishings have been REARRANGED to their original state of disarray - 

Paralyzed with fear, the char woman takes a few steps back - 

Soon there is sound of a DETERGENT BOTTLE rattling on the ground - 

The char woman turns and sees it - 

The bottle suddenly rattles across the floor, as if kicked gently by an invisible man - the woman
gasps- the bottle continues to be kicked around, gently at first, then the top pops off - 

The char woman stands frozen as the bottle sits dormant as some of the contents glug glug glugs
out on the floor - 

Suddenly the bottle is KICKED violently - the woman cringes as she is SPATTERED with cleanser - 

The bottle slams around and finally rises and - 
SMASSHHH! SLAMS against the wall within inches of the woman's head - 

The woman frantically runs out the front door - leaves blow in from the outside - 

The women jump into the car and hastily start it  - as they do a strong gust of wind SLAMS the
door shut - we hear the car peel away - 

									FADE OUT
									CUT TO
EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - DAY

POV of a VIDEO CAMCORDER turning on - it focuses on the house.  It is a new day, and a midsize
RENTAL VAN is parked out front - in front of it is an American AUTOMOBILE - 

				WILL(V.O.)
		Well, it's moving day, and we
		finally made it here. 

The camera starts walking toward the house - 

				WILL (V.O.)
		Glen Abbey manor, getting some 
		new tenants...
		
The camera TURNS to reveal WILL SOUTH, an American in his 30's, taping himself - 

				WILL
		Let me take you on a tour...

EXT MANOR ENTRANCE - DAY

The video camera focuses on the front door - the camera approaches a tarnished lion's head KNOCKER
- 

We see Will's free hand knock at the door - 

				WILL(O.S.)
		Not bad...

Just then the camera turns to show AUBREY SOUTH, a dark-haired 6 year-old girl, approach the front
door carrying a doll -


				WILL(O.S.)
		Here comes Aubrey, say hi Aubrey.

Aubrey looks at the camera, then back at the house - 

				AUBREY
		Hi.


As Aubrey heads in MAURA SOUTH, an attractive woman in her 30's, exits the house and heads toward
the van - 

				WILL(O.S.)
		And there's Maura, doing a little
		unpacking...

Maura takes a box out of the back of the van - 

				MAURA
		I could use a little help. We have
		to return the van soon.

				WILL(O.S.)
		Ok ok...we're just gonna head 
		inside here...

The camera approaches the front door - 

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The camera pans the living room, filled with a few boxes amid the other furniture - 

				WILL(O.S.)
		This is the living room...

The camera approaches the FIREPLACE and then pans to the PORTRAIT on the wall of ELIZA LONDRIGAN - 

				WILL(O.S.)
		Here's a picture of...someone...
		she doesn't look too happy.

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

The camera automatically adjusts its light to show the upstairs hallway - 

				WILL(O.S.)
		Ok, this is the upstairs...

The camera then heads down the hallway, toward a bedroom - 


				WILL(O.S.)
		And down here is a bedroom...
		let's take a look at that - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

As the camera pans into the room, we see Aubrey standing in the middle of it, looking at her
father with a blank look on her face - her doll is on the floor - 

				WILL(O.S.)
		Hey.

Aubrey says nothing, staring at Will with a trance-like expression - 

				WILL(O.S.)
		What are you doing honey?

Aubrey just stares back - 

				WILL(O.S.)
		Aubrey?

Will then lowers the camera and looks at Aubrey - 

Will's faint smile fades - 

				WILL
		Are you ok?

Aubrey looks at Will until he touches her shoulder -  

				AUBREY
		Can I have this room daddy?

				WILL
		Sure.
			(Beat)
		Did you see the others?

				AUBREY
			(Beat)
		I want this one, daddy.

				WILL
		Ok.
			(Beat)
		If you want this room, you can
		have it.

Will kisses Aubrey's head, and walks out of the room - Aubrey continues to look around - 

									DISSOLVE TO

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

The South's CAR drives down a scenic road, lush green fields and whitewashed stone fences - 

INT CAR - DAY

Will drives, Maura sits in the passenger seat -

Aubrey sits in the back seat, looking out the window - 

				WILL
		Well, we're not in California
		anymore...
			(Beat)
		Sure is beautiful.

Maura seems to be concentrating on something - 

				MAURA
		Now remember we have to call someone
		about that replacing that water 
		heater.

				WILL
		Yeah I'll look into that tonight.

				MAURA
			(Beat, looks out 
			 window)
		I hope we have more success than
		we did with the cleaning service.

				WILL
		The place is pretty dusty.

				MAURA
		Well the realtor said that was 
		going to be taken care of and it 
		wasn't.  I'll have to call her.

				WILL
		Who knows...
			(Beat)
		we have to get used to living around
		here.  Maybe good help is hard to 
		find. 

				MAURA
		Must be...


EXT ROAD - DAY

The car drives away - 
									DISSOLVE TO 							
INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Maura unpacks the contents of a box as Will walks in with another box -

Will places the box down, and approaching Maura from 
behind - 

				WILL
		Well, we're officially in.

Will puts his arms around her - she doesn't respond - 

				WILL
			(gesturing)
		I think the bed should face this
		way.  What do you think?

Maura says nothing -  

				WILL
		What's the matter?

				MAURA
		Will, maybe we should have 
		separate bedrooms for a while.

				WILL
		Oh come on...

				MAURA
		I just, I don't know...

				WILL
		What will Aubrey think? 

				MAURA
		Aubrey knows more about us 
		than you think.

Maura walks away and opens another box, inspecting the contents - 



				WILL
		Well maybe we don't need to 
		remind her of it.  She has
		a lot more to adjust to...new
		friends, new schools...it
		would be good if she had a
		stable family environment.

				MAURA
		You didn't think much about 
		that before.

				WILL
		Look, I thought we were all right
		on this, Maura.
			(Beat)
		It's over.  You know that.

Maura turns and looks at Will - 

				MAURA
			(Beat)
		It's just going to take a while.

				WILL
		Whatever you say.

Maura walks away - 

				MAURA
		I think I'll start dinner.

Will watches Maura leave the room - 
									DISSOLVE TO
INT DINING ROOM - DUSK

CLOSE on a black and white PHOTOGRAPH from the 1930's framed on the wall: a WOMAN in her 20's
bearing a resemblance to Maura, posing with a MAN, presumably her husband -

				WILL(O.S.)
		Well, I suppose I should make a 
		toast.  

Will, Maura, and Aubrey sit around a large wooden table and have dinner - Will reaches for his
wine glass, raises it to Maura and Aubrey, then gestures to the picture -  



				WILL
		To Eliza Londrigan, for keeping
		this house in the family.

Maura raises her glass and they look at each other for a beat before clinking glasses - 

Aubrey raises her wine glass full of milk - 

				MAURA
		To our family.

				WILL
		To our family.

They clink glasses with Aubrey - Maura looks at the 
picture - 

				MAURA
		I wish I knew more about her.		

				WILL
		Did anyone in your family keep
		in touch with her?

				MAURA
		Not really.  She was just one of 
		those names you hear growing up. 
		You know, so-and-so who lives in 
		Ireland.
			(Beat)
		I really don't think anyone knew 
		about this place.

				WILL
		Or what she was worth.

Maura gives Will a look - 

				WILL
		God rest her soul.

				MAURA
		I don't think she willed it to me
		out of sentiment.  She didn't even
		know who I was.  It's just...
		tradition.

Suddenly there is the eerie sound of distant THUDDING, as if some heavy presence walks above them -

Aubrey looks at her parents, then around the room - no one says anything for a beat - 

				WILL
		Did you hear something?

Maura waits to hear it again - 

				AUBREY
		What was it?

BOOM BOOM...BOOM BOOM - the sound is louder - 

Will looks toward the front door - 

Will gets up and heads to the front door - Aubrey watches him - 

INT FOYER - DUSK

Will walks past some boxes and opens the door - 

There in the doorway stands the startling presence of FATHER SEAMUS, a reedy, older Catholic
priest with sunken eyes and ashen skin - the air is foggy - 

Will is taken aback by the man, waits a beat to compose himself -  

				WILL
		Can I help you?

Father Seamus slowly breaks into a faint smile, mirthless and creepy - 

				SEAMUS
		You must be the new tenants.

				WILL
		And you...are?

Seamus takes his hat off - the wind blows his wisps of 
hair -

				SEAMUS
		My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from
		Holy Rood church.

				WILL
		How can I help you?

At this point Maura approaches, Aubrey behind her - 

				SEAMUS
		I came to see if everything is 
		all right.

Maura and Seamus make eye contact - 

				SEAMUS
		You must be a Londrigan.

				MAURA
		Yes, I am.

				WILL
		She's a South now.

Will extends his hand - Seamus shakes it - 

				WILL
		I'm Will South.  This is Maura,
		our daughter Aubrey.  This is...
		Father Seamus?

Aubrey looks at Seamus with trepidation - 

				SEAMUS
		Yes.  I'm sorry to call on you
		at this hour.  You see, I knew 
		Eliza well, and out of deference 
		to her, I came by...to welcome 
		you...and to bless this house...		

Will, Maura and Aubrey look at the priest for a beat -

				SEAMUS
		...at her request.  She was a 
		very religious woman.

				MAURA
		Oh, that's nice...

				SEAMUS
			(Beat)
		May I come in?

				WILL
			(Beat)
		Sure, sure...

INT DINING ROOM - DUSK

Father Seamus looks around the room warily - Will, Aubrey and Maura follow him in -

Father Seamus takes out some HOLY WATER and sprinkles it about the room - he then crosses himself
and solemnly mutters a prayer, closing his eyes - 

Aubrey looks at Will - 

				AUBREY
			(whispering)
		What's he doing daddy?

				WILL
			(whispering)
		He's blessing the house.

				AUBREY
			(whispering)
		Why?

				WILL
		For good luck honey.		

Seamus reads from his prayer book - 

				SEAMUS
		Hear us, Holy Lord, and deign to 
		send thy holy angel from heaven to
		guard, cherish, protect, visit, and
		defend all who dwell in this home.

Will and Maura watch him - Aubrey looks at her parents - 
	
				SEAMUS(O.S.)
		Per Christum Dominum nostrum.  Amen.

Seamus finishes his prayer, and crosses himself - 

As if coming out of a trance, Seamus turns and faces the family - 
				SEAMUS
		Thank you.  I believe she would
		have wanted it.

				MAURA
		Did you know her very well?

Seamus looks at her, then around at the room - 

				SEAMUS
		She attended the church for years.
		A dear woman, it was sad to see
		her decline so rapidly.

				MAURA
		It was a shame.

				SEAMUS
			(nods)
		In her later years she would often
		get very disoriented being alone
		here.  She would call me, and I 
		would come by.

				WILL
		What was she afraid of?

				SEAMUS
		Well, I believe her mind was
		playing tricks on her, God rest
		her soul.  She would hear things,
		see things...
		
				MAURA
		Well it's nice that you were 
		there for her.

				SEAMUS
		I took pity on the poor woman.
		This house is too big for one
		person to live alone in...

Seamus looks at Aubrey - 

				SEAMUS
		It needs to be filled with the
		laughter of children...right?

Aubrey looks up at the priest - 

				AUBREY
		Did you grow up in Ireland 
		mister?
 
				WILL
		That's father, Aubrey.
				SEAMUS
		Well yes I did.  Lived here my 
		whole life.

				AUBREY
			(Beat)
		Did you ever see a leprechaun?

				SEAMUS
			(Beat, smiles)
		A leprechaun?  Well, let me tell
		you.  They've been known to roam
		the land, and like it very much
		when you leave a bowl of milk out
		for them during the night.

Aubrey looks at Maura - 

				AUBREY
		Can we leave out a bowl of milk,
		mommy?

				MAURA
		Sure.

Aubrey heads toward the kitchen -  

Seamus watches Aubrey head off, then smiles back at Will and Maura - 

				WILL
		Did you have dinner, father?  We
		have plenty.

				SEAMUS
		Well thank you for the offer, 
			(Beat)
		But I really have to go.


EXT MANOR - DUSK

The front door opens and Father Seamus steps out -

Seamus then turns and looks at them earnestly -



				SEAMUS
		I hope everything works out for you,
		and you find happiness in your new 
		home.

				WILL
		Thank you.

				SEAMUS
		Perhaps I'll see you in church.

Will and Maura look at each other then at the priest - 

				MAURA
		Uh, we're not really practicing
		Catholics...

Father Seamus smiles politely - 

				SEAMUS
		Well there's no time like the 
		present.
			(Beat)
		Good night.

				WILL
		Good night.

				MAURA
		Good night.

Father Seamus heads away from the house, into the fog - 

Will and Maura watch him leave as they close the door - 

INT FOYER - DUSK

Will and Maura look at each other -

				WILL
		Well that was strange.

Aubrey then emerges with a bowl of milk -

				MAURA
		Ah, he's a nice man. Who knows,
		maybe he misses her.

Aubrey puts the bowl of milk down outside the front door and looks at Will and Maura - 

				AUBREY
		For the leprechauns.

Will gently leads her back inside - 

				WILL
		For the leprechauns.

Will closes the front door - 

									DISSOLVE TO
EXT MANOR - NIGHT

Crickets chirp - lights are on in the upper floors only - 

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Will begins to set up his video equipment, connecting the VCR cables to the TELEVISION -

He takes the VHS CASSETTE from the camcorder and places it the VCR and rewinds it - 

INT MASTER BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Maura is in her bathrobe taking the last three heavy hardcover BOOKS out of a box - she places the
books on the edge of the bed, and tears the box so it's flat - she puts the box on a pile of other
flattened boxes and picks up a final box, labeled BATHROOM -

She heads into the bathroom - 

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Will rewinds the tape with the remote, and hits play - we hear no sound but Will seems concerned
with what's on the screen - 

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Maura continues to put various JARS of medicine away on shelves in the bathroom - as she does she
hears a brief but distinctive sound of a HUMAN VOICE whisper something unintelligible - she
listens - a beat of silence, then -

THREE LOUD THUDS come from the bedroom, jolting Maura - she turns -

INT MASTER BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Maura slowly pokes her head out the door - she then looks down on the ground with a troubled look-
she walks into the bedroom - 

We see her crouch down to pick up the three books, which have been FLUNG across the room and lie
open and askew on the floor - she picks them up and looks around the room - 

Suddenly something dawns on her - her expression changes, and she smiles faintly - 

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Will looks at the screen with a troubled look on his face - 

Maura comes in with a faint smile - Will does not acknowledge her, continuing to stare at the
screen  - 

				MAURA
		Are you playing tricks on me?

				WILL
			(Beat)
		What?

				MAURA
		It's not going to work.  I'm too
		smart for you.

Maura then looks at the screen as Will remotes the volume - 

				MAURA
		What are you watching?

Maura approaches - 

				WILL
		It's the video I made...

POV the screen shows the house tour, but the image is GROTESQUELY DISTORTED, and GUTTURAL, TWISTED
SOUNDS of
suffering and SCREAMING intersperse with the static -  		
Maura and Will stare at it in shock, listening for a beat - 

				MAURA
		What the hell is that?

				WILL
		I don't know.  That's strange.

Will fast-forwards and plays it, but it is more of the same throughout -

				WILL
		I'm sure this was a blank tape.
		I must have screwed up.
			(Beat)
		Damn it.  What is all this?

Maura looks at Will - 

				MAURA
		Were you just upstairs?

Will looks at the screen - 

				WILL
		No.  Why?

Maura thinks about it for a beat -

				MAURA
		You didn't come in and knock
		over some books?

Will looks at Maura for a beat then back at the screen - 

				WILL
		No.  Maybe it was Aubrey. 

				MAURA
		She's asleep.  
			(Beat)
		I think that's what I need, too.  
		I'm starting to see things.

				WILL
		Yeah, well I'll be joining you 
		shortly.  I just want to...

Will fast forwards some more - 

				WILL
		...set up some more things.

				MAURA
		Ok.

Maura looks at the screen for a beat, then heads down the hall -
Will continues to look at the screen with a concerned expression - 

CLOSE on the screen as the distorted images and sounds 
play -

EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - FRONT DOOR - DAY

Aubrey opens the front door - she looks down at the bowl from the previous night and picks it up - 

The bowl is empty - Aubrey smiles - just then she looks up, appearing somewhat startled - 

A large burly PLUMBER stands and faces her - Aubrey says nothing - 

				PLUMBER
		Hello there little girl.

				AUBREY
		Hello.

				PLUMBER
			(Beat)
		Are your parents in?

Aubrey turns and looks inside - 

				AUBREY
			(loud)
		Daddy!  There's a man out here!

The man looks around, feeling a little uncomfortable - 

Will approaches the door -

				PLUMBER
		I'm here with the new heater.

Will opens the door and steps back - 

				WILL
		Oh, great, c'mon in.

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Will, Aubrey and the plumber enter the hallway - Aubrey lifts the bowl to show Will - 


				AUBREY
		Look daddy!  It's empty!

				WILL
		That's great, honey.

Aubrey looks at the plumber - 

				AUBREY
		The leprechauns drank it last 
		night!

The Irish plumber looks at Aubrey -

				PLUMBER
		Uh huh.
			(to Will)
		Before I bring it in I'll take 
		the old one.

Will heads toward the cellar - 

				WILL
		Ok.  It's down here in the cellar
		if you want to follow me.

INT CELLAR - DAY

The camera pans the staircase to show Will and the plumber in the dark, damp cellar, standing by
the old water heater - 

				WILL
		Thanks for coming by.  You're
		the fourth guy I had to call!

The plumber shuts the water off from the old heater - 

				PLUMBER
		Well you called the right man.  
		This new heater's a great deal If 
		I do say so meself.

The plumber looks at Will as he dismantles the old heater - 

				PLUMBER
		Fifty gallon capacity, r-foam 
		insulation, low w.c. manifold and
		a radial flame spreader!

Will looks at him, failing to make the connection - 

				PLUMBER				
		For lower N.O. emissions.

				WILL
		Oh, right.

The plumber begins to dismantle to old heater - 

		
INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Maura carries a full laundry basket down the hall, passing Aubrey who sits on the floor of her
room playing with her dolls - 

				AUBREY
		Mommy, the leprechauns drank the
		milk last night.

				MAURA
		Well I bet you they're happy.

Maura opens up some cabinets and begins to put away some folded towels onto some shelves - 

				AUBREY(O.S.)
		Can I do it again tonight?

				MAURA
		We'll have every leprechaun in

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Aubrey has several DOLLS facing her in a semi-circle, some old, some new - she combs the hair on
one doll, a porcelain one -

Aubrey picks up one doll which has a CORD on its neck - Aubrey pulls the string - 

				DOLL(V.O.)
		Hi, what's your name?

INT CELLAR - DAY

Having disconnected the heater, the plumber prepares to remove it - Will approaches him- 

				WILL
		You want a hand with that?

				PLUMBER
		Sure.
The two men begin to WRENCH the rusted heater free - they pull and pull until the heater begins to
slide off the foundation - soon it is removed - 

				PLUMBER
		Back's rusted all to hell.

The plumber heads upstairs as Will wipes his hands - something then catches his attention - 

Will crouches down, inspects the mildewed wall - as he smears away the dirt, he reveals an ancient
bronze AMULET adorned with CRYPTIC SYMBOLS, six inches in diameter,  nailed to the wall - 

Intrigued, Will stares at it for a beat - 

				WILL
		What's this?

Will begins to loosen it - 

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Maura continues to put away the laundry when suddenly the LIGHTS begin to flicker - Maura looks
around - 

The lights go OUT for a beat, then back on - and then SMASH!  a light bulb EXPLODES - 

Startled, Maura looks around, then heads downstairs - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Aubrey looks at the doll, whose face smiles yet has an eerie quality to it - 

Aubrey pulls the string again - 

				DOLL(V.O.)
		Hi. What's your name?

Aubrey looks at the doll - 


				AUBREY
		Aubrey...

Aubrey pulls on the string again - 


				DOLL(V.O.)
		Do you want to play...Aubrey?

Aubrey stares at the doll as if being drawn in by some 
force - 

The doll stares up at her - 

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Will heads up the stairs inspecting the amulet as Maura approaches him -

				WILL
		The heater's here.

				MAURA
		Were you fooling with the power?

				WILL
		No.

				MAURA
		Didn't you just see the power go 
		off and on?  I just had a bulb break 
		on me!

Will looks at Maura - 

				WILL
		No.  I don't know.
			(Beat)
		Look at this.

Maura notices the amulet - 

				MAURA
		What is it?

				WILL
		It was in the cellar.
			(Beat)
		Weird.

				MAURA
		Well something just happened to
		the power upstairs...
Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event - 

Will continues to smear the dirt off the amulet - 

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Maura walks up the stairs - she then looks ahead and GASPS in fright -  

POV - ALL the cabinet doors are WIDE OPEN - towels are all over the floor - 

Maura slowly approaches the opened doors  with growing impatience - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Maura pokes her head in - 

				MAURA
		Aubrey, did you do this?

Aubrey holds the doll, and shakes her head no - 

				MAURA
			(angry)
		Don't play games with me, little 
		girl.

				AUBREY
		I didn't do anything, mommy.

				MAURA
		Well then who did?!

				AUBREY
		Maybe it was Colleen...

				MAURA
		Who...is Colleen?

Aubrey looks at Maura for a beat, then holds up the doll, and smiles -

INT STUDY - NIGHT

The cleaned-off amulet is propped on a shelf - the sound of a running SHOWER can be heard in the
background - 



PAN to see Will in his pajama bottoms, sitting in front of a COMPUTER - he leans back in his chair
and stares at the screen - he rubs his chin with one hand, types in random commands with the other
- 

He waits for a beat, shakes his head - 

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Maura is in the shower - she leans against the wall, letting the hot water cascade over her head
and down her bare, exposed breasts  - 

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Will hits another command, then lifts the keyboard, inspects it, puts it down - 

				WILL
		God damn it...

PAN to show the computer screen - Will tries to run a VIRUS CHECK program - he hits enter - 

There is a pause - the screen is filled with a FLURRY of gibberish - the computer beeps
uncontrollably - 

				WILL
		What the hell is wrong with this 
		thing?

Will turns the computer off, stands up, sighs - 

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Maura turns the water off - she picks up a towel and begins to dry off - 

Suddenly she hears the CLEAR SOUND of a woman's voice abrubtly say something in Gaelic - Maura
GASPS and spins around - 

No one is there - dripping with water, Maura looks around, clearly troubled by what she heard - 

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Maura opens the bedroom door and walks into the bedroom - 

Will approaches her as she dries her hair - 




				WILL
		I tell you everything seems to
		have broken in the move.  Now the
		computer's screwed up.

Maura just stares at him for a beat, then heads over to the mirror and dries her hair - 

Will approaches her, kisses her neck - 

				WILL
		Mmmm....I love you right out of the
		shower...

Will begins to gently remove the towel - Maura resists - she then walks away from him and takes a
nightgown out of a dresser - Will watches her - 

				WILL
		What's the matter, Maura?

Maura drops the towel and put on the nightgown -

				MAURA
		I don't know...

She then turns and faces Will - 

				MAURA
		Some strange things have been 
		going on around here.  Very
		strange things. 


Will looks at her for a beat, having misread her reluctant behavior - 

				MAURA
			(Beat)
		Weird sounds, things moving, lights
		going off.
			(Beat)
		The videotape...

				WILL
		So what are you saying?

				MAURA
			(Beat)
		I don't know what I'm saying.
		
Maura laughs faintly then turns and looks at Will 
earnestly - 

				MAURA
		But do you agree with me?

				WILL
		Yeah, I'd say some weird things have
		happened.

				MAURA
		Well what do you think it is?

Will looks at Maura for a beat - 

				WILL
		Well, I try to keep an open mind, 
		but...

				MAURA
		Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after
		all.

				WILL
		There's got to be an explanation.  
		It could be a magnetic flux or
		something, maybe the power lines
		are giving off something.  Who
		knows?
			(Beat)
		I don't know, I think it's kind 
		of interesting.

				MAURA
		Well what power lines, Will?  Where?
			(Beat)
		Maybe we should call someone about
		it.

				WILL
		Who?

				MAURA
		I don't know.  Someone who...knows
		about this kind of stuff.

				WILL
		Oh come on!

				MAURA
		What about keeping an open mind?




				WILL
		Just because I have an open mind
		doesn't mean I'm going to pay 
		some snake oil peddler to come
		in and shake a voodoo stick around 
		the house.

				MAURA
		Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that 
		Will.  You're just being cynical.

				WILL
		I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a
		spiritual side.
			(Beat)
		I mean, we had a priest come in and
		bless the house.  That should count
		for something.

Suddenly the air is pierced with CRASHING and SCREAMING - it is Aubrey - 

Maura jumps out of bed and rushes toward Aubrey's room - Will follows her - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Maura bursts the door open - they see Aubrey but not what she's screaming at - 

Then suddenly a strange black CREATURE LEAPS in front of them across the dark room and rapidly
DISAPPEARS as it passes through the wide open window - 

Aubrey RUNS to her mother grabbing her for dear life - the curtains blow frantically - 

				AUBREY		
		It was a monster!  It was a
		monster!

Will RUSHES down the hall, ripping open a drawer -


				MAURA
		Oh my God - Will!

Will grabs a FLASHLIGHT  - as he does he sees something in the study -




INT STUDY - NIGHT

POV the computer screen is fully LIT UP with numbers and letters rapidly flashing across the
screen - 

Maura picks up an hysterical Aubrey and brings her into their bedroom - 

				MAURA
		Shh shh shh!

Will runs down the stairs and yanks the door open - 

EXT MANOR - NIGHT

Will runs around the corner of the house, pointing the flashlight in all directions - 

INT MASTER BEDROOM  - NIGHT

Aubrey cowers on the bed, hysterical - 

				AUBREY
		It's going to hurt us!

				MAURA
		No it won't - no it won't!

Maura frantically pulls a SKELETON KEY out of the door  - 

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Maura slams the door to Aubrey's bedroom shut and locks it, fumbling with the key - 

EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - NIGHT

Will makes his way around the other side of the house - we can see his breath in the cold, damp
air as he point the flashlight around - 

POV we see the surrounding in the dark of night - the flashlight beam runs into distant trees and
scenery, but nothing moves - 
Slightly out of breath, Will stands alone in the darkness, as the wind blows around him -

									DISSOLVE TO
EXT COMMERCIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

ESTABLISH the neighborhood of a quaint Irish town, with people walking the streets amid shops and
offices - 

Will and Maura approach the front of a building - 

Maura checks a piece of paper with the corresponding 
address - 

She looks at the building, then at Will - 

				MAURA
		This is it.

Will looks at Maura for a beat, then together the two of them head in - 

									DISSOLVE TO	
INSERT DOOR IN HALLWAY - DAY

We see a SIGN on a doorway - it reads:

					DR. EDWARD SHEA
				Psychic/Spiritual Advisor

				SHEA(O.S.)
		Did it harm either one of you?
		Or your daughter?

INT SHEA'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE on a hand pulling a cigarette out of a package on a desk - 

				MAURA(O.S.)
			(softly)
		No.

We see EDWARD SHEA, an eccentric-looking man in his 40's as he lights the cigarette - behind him
are various occult and spiritual items on shelves and on the walls - 

				SHEA
		Did it leave any tracks, or 
		footprints of any kind?


				WILL(O.S.)
		No.  Nothing.

A haggard-looking Will and Maura face Shea - 

				WILL
		It just disappeared.  Literally.

				MAURA
			(Beat)
		I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.

				SHEA
		Not at all.  I'm just trying to
		put together all the evidence, to
		determine what it could possibly
		be.

				MAURA
		Well that's what we're here for.
		I mean - 

Maura laughs faintly, then becomes serious again - 		

				MAURA
		We don't know.
	
				SHEA
		I could see if I detect the 
		presence of something.

				WILL
		What do you have, some kind of 
		meter or something like that?

Shea looks at him - 

				SHEA
		No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I
		can sometimes talk to unhappy
		spirits inhabiting a certain 
		place.

				WILL
		Oh.

				MAURA
		Well what would you do, in our
		case?


				SHEA
		Well it all depends on how much
		money you want to spend.
			(Beat)
		A standard visit would run
		you about fifty pounds.  That 
		would include myself and an 
		assistant.

				WILL
		And what would you do?

				SHEA
		Well, we could bring in special 
		equipment, monitors, sound devices, 
		things like that.

Maura looks at Will - 

				MAURA
		I think we should do it.

				SHEA 
		We're usually successful in 
		detecting the source of most 
		problems.
			(Beat)
		Unfortunately.

				MAURA
		What do you mean, unfortunately?

				SHEA
		We usually find nothing.  We've 
		debunked many a reported haunting.  
		About ninety five percent of the 
		cases had some technical 
		explanation.

				MAURA
		What about the other five percent?

Shea looks at the two of them - 

				SHEA
		Well...it's that five percent that 
		keeps us interested...



INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

We see AMY WOLFE, a very attractive historian in her 30's, taking snapshots of the house with a
DIGITAL CAMERA - around her neck are other sophisticated devices including a DIGITAL thermometer- 

Amy turns and looks at Will -
 
				AMY
		They don't build them like this 
		anymore.

				WILL
		Suppose not.

We then see Will and Amy follow Shea and Maura toward the stairs - 
				SHEA
		Where is your daughter?  She
		might be able to give us some
		information.

				MAURA
		She's at school.  We've tried not
		to upset her more than she's been.

The group begins to head upstairs - 

				SHEA
		That's understandable.  But sometimes
		spirits prefer to communicate with
		children.  Innocence, perhaps.

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Shea leads the group up the stairs - 

				SHEA
		I feel something.  It's faint, 
		but...it's there...

				AMY
		You say you saw some activity
		here?



				MAURA
		Yes.  All these cabinets opened
		by themselves.

				AMY
		Did you see them open?

				MAURA
		Uh, no, but - 

				AMY
		See the key to this type of
		thing is to see it as it 
		happens - empirical observation
		is the best way to come to
		a conclusion as to cause.

Maura nods - Amy runs an ELECTRICAL SENSOR up and down the cabinets - she turns to Maura - 

				AMY
		I'm getting nothing here.

EXT ROAD - DAY

A SCHOOL BUS pulls up - Aubrey gets out, waves to the driver, and runs toward her house - 

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Amy follows her meter toward the door of Aubrey's bedroom -  

Shea concentrates, as if picking up some kind of vibe - 		
				SHEA
		I'm feeling something, but it
		seems as if it's...moving...

Amy pauses, tries to open the door, but it's locked - Maura approaches with a key and unlocks it - 

				MAURA
		This used to be Aubrey's room.
			(Beat)
		She stays with us now.

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Amy, Shea, Will and Maura enter the room - as they do - 

The window then CREAKS and opens outward - 

Amy pulls out a DIGITAL THERMOMETER and walks around the room -

He waves the thermometer at different in the room - 

Shea begins to concentrate, closes his eyes - soon it is apparent that he entering some type of
trance - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

POV of what Shea envisions:  The room is bathed in candlelight - in the center of the room is a
large CANOPY BED, whose curtains blow gently in the wind - 

As we approach the bed we see a VOLUPTUOUS WOMAN in a sheer nightgown roll over in her sleep - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

CLOSE on Shea as he opens his eyes and stares forward, lost in a deep hallucination - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Shea's POV  - panning down from the sleeping woman we see the floor and the antique rug - then
slowly a MALE HAND
enters the floor presumably belonging to someone lying on the floor - after a beat it drags itself
forward - 

As it does we soon see it is SEVERED below the wrist - it continues to claw forward - 

INT AUBREY'S ROOM - DAY

Amy waves the thermometer around - 

Will and Maura watch Amy as she walks around the room - 

EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - DAY

Aubrey heads toward the house - 

We see the BOWL on the stoop, but not its contents - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Amy stops walking, examines the thermometer - she frowns and waves the thermometer back and forth
through a foot-wide patch of air -

Will and Maura approach her, see that the TEMPERATURE DROPS dramatically, but only in that given
spot - 

CLOSE on Shea, deeply entranced and motionless - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Shea's POV - we approach the sleeping woman as she rolls onto her back - as we get closer to the
upper portion of her body we see her stir - 

She slowly opens her eyes, looks down - her EYES WIDEN - 

The hand is ON HER STOMACH - 

She SCREAMS in horror and leaps out of the bed as the hand TEARS the nightgown off her body - 

As she recoils the hand CLENCHES TIGHTLY around her throat in a chokehold - she struggles in vain -

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Will and Maura look at the thermometer with Amy - thing - 

Then, as if the spell has broken for Shea he COLLAPSES back against the wall - the other approach
him as Will helps him get his balance - 

				WILL
		Whoa there...

				MAURA
		Are you ok?		

				AMY
		What happened?

Shea feels his head, frightened and disoriented - 

				SHEA
		I don't know...my God...

EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - DAY

Aubrey looks down at the contents of the bowl with a concerned expression - 

A RED SWIRL begins to form in the milk - 

Aubrey's eyes widen as she inspects the bowl - then 
suddenly - 
The bloody milk SPATTERS Aubrey's face - she screams - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Will and Maura hear the screams and run down the stairs, followed by the others-

INT FOYER - DAY

Will runs to the door and opens it - 

A bloodstained Aubrey grabs her mother -

Will and Maura looks in the bowl - 

The bowl is filled with blackened, discolored BLOOD - 

									DISSOLVE TO
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Will and Maura sit on a couch, Aubrey sits on Maura's lap as her mother cleans off her face -   

Shea inspects the blood in the bowl with a medical-looking PROBE - 

				SHEA
		Looks like we have some animal
		hairs in here.  Maybe some kind
		of a rodent.

				WILL
		So is that what all this is?  
		Someone have a problem with us
		living here?

				SHEA
		Not someone.  Something. I've never 
		felt a presence that strong before.

				MAURA
		Ok, so we have a...presence.  What
		do we do about it?

				SHEA
		If we have a troubled spirit here,
		we have to find out why it's 
		troubled.

Amy is online on her portable computer - soon her PORTABLE FAX begins to spit out documents, town
records, and listings of residents - 

				AMY
		Town records are coming up now. 

				WILL
		What will they tell you?

				AMY
		I'll be able to do a search, to find
		out who lived here previously.
			(Beat)
		And who died here.

Amy keeps typing at the computer -

				AMY
		We know the house was built in 
		1863.  Your family, the Londrigans,
		first established residence after 
		the first world war, so...we have an
		unknown window, 1863 to 1919.

Shea concentrates for a beat, then - 

				SHEA
		Do you have any other physical
		evidence, that we can look at?

				WILL
		Not really.
			(Beat)
		Oh, wait a minute.  

Will stands up - 

				WILL
		I think I do.

CLOSE on the AMULET - Shea examines it with a MAGNIFYING GLASS - 

				SHEA
		Where did you find this?

				WILL
		It was nailed to the cellar wall.

				SHEA
		I see some faint lettering.  It
		appears to be the...Runic alphabet?

				WILL
		Runic?


				SHEA
		I'm not sure, but I can check.
			(Beat)
		Did the events start before or 
		after you discovered this?

				MAURA
		Before.


				SHEA
		Do you mind if I borrow it?

				WILL
		Not at all, if it can help.

				AMY
			(looking at
			 computer)
		Damn it.

				SHEA
		What's the matter?

				AMY
		These records only go back to 1880.
		But...
			(Beat)
		...wait a minute...

Will, Maura and Shea approach Amy at her computer -

				SHEA
		Did you find something?

				AMY
		I did a cross search, death
		certificates with this address.
		James and Marion Foster.  They
		had a daughter.  Right here, it
		says James died, 1882, pneumonia.
		Marion dies September the next 
		year. Suicide.

				WILL
		Suicide?  How?








				AMY
		It doesn't say.
			(scanning the screen)
		But that's not what interests
		me.
			(Beat)
		There's no death certificate
		for the daughter.  Anywhere.

				SHEA
		What was her name?

				AMY
		Colleen.

				MAURA
		Colleen...

Maura turns and looks over at Aubrey - 

Aubrey looks back at her - Maura approaches her - 

 				MAURA
		Honey, isn't your friend's name
		Colleen?

				AUBREY
		Yes.

Shea approaches Maura and Aubrey - 

				MAURA
		Can you talk to her?

				AUBREY
		She talks to me.

Will approaches - 

				WILL
		What are you talking about?

				MAURA
		She has a...friend.  Colleen.

				WILL
		A friend?

				MAURA
			(to Will)
		You, an imaginary friend.  That's
		what she calls her.


Shea crouches down to talk to her - 

				SHEA
		What does Colleen say to you?

The others listen - Aubrey stares at Shea - 

				AUBREY
		She says she's lonely...

				SHEA
		Where is she?

				AUBREY
			(Beat)
		She's here.

				SHEA
		Where is she now?

				AUBREY
		She's hiding. 

Will looks at Maura - 

				SHEA
		Can you take me to her?

Aubrey then seems to fall into a hypnotic spell - 

				AUBREY
			(Beat)
		She's down...

				MAURA
		She's down...how do you mean
		honey?

				SHEA
		Do you mean she's sad?


				AUBREY
		She's down.  Help her...

				SHEA
		Take me to her.

Aubrey looks at Shea for a beat, then slowly shakes her 
head - 
				SHEA
		Ok...ok...

Shea stands up, and looks at Will and Maura - 

				SHEA
		Well, maybe we're getting 
		somewhere.

Just then Amy realizes something - 

				AMY
		Wait a minute.  She's down...
			(Beat)
		Where did you find that medal
		again?
		
Will looks at Amy - 

				WILL
		In the cellar.

Amy then looks at Shea - 

INT CELLAR - DAY

Aubrey and Shea descend the staircase - Will, Maura and Amy follow - 

Shea stands in the center of the room - he closes his eyes, concentrates for a beat - 


				SHEA
		Colleen...Colleen...

The others watch him - Will and Maura look at each other - 

				SHEA
		We want to help you...can you talk
		to me?

There is no response - 

Amy tests the room with her electrical device - 

				SHEA
		If you're lonely you can talk
		to us...Colleen...

Aubrey then starts to walk toward the other side of the 
room - no one pays much notice - 

				SHEA
		Colleen...can you tell me where
		you are...

Will does a double-take towards the other side of the room - 
Aubrey stands in front of the wall - slowly she raises her hand and places it up against the wall -

Will gestures to Maura, who sees Aubrey - 

				MAURA
		Aubrey?

Shea then looks over to Aubrey -

Aubrey has both hands against the wall - 

Shea and the others slowly approach - 

Shea slowly puts his hands against the wall - 

Aubrey backs off as Shea closes his eyes, concentrates - 

The others watch - 

Suddenly Shea backs up and opens his eyes - 

				SHEA
		There's something in there.

				WILL
		What?

				SHEA
		There's something through that wall!

				WILL
		Well what is it!

				SHEA
		I don't know!  Trust what I'm 
		saying, we have to open this wall!

INT CELLAR - NIGHT

Shea and Will continue bash away at the wall, knocking away chunks of concrete - 

Shea sees something - gestures to Will to stop hammering - 

				SHEA
		Oh my God...

Will then sees something - he steps back - 

The others gather around, and look in horror at what they find -

broken bones and shattered skull -

									DISSOLVE TO
EXT HOLY ROOD CHURCH - DAY

Will, Maura, Aubrey, Shea and Amy join Father Seamus around a fresh grave on the Hillside - the
sky is gray - 

Seamus administers last rites in Latin - the others solemnly listen - 

Seamus then crosses himself, and closes his prayer book - 

				SEAMUS
		May you find the peace you've
		sought in vain for so long.

				AMY
		That poor little girl.

				SHEA
		So many unanswered questions.  Why
		was she buried there.  And who
		killed her?

				AMY
		It might have been her mother.

				SHEA
		We don't have proof of that.

				AMY
		The style of dress on the girl...
		it coincides with the era Marion
		Foster killed herself.  
			(Beat)
		Who else could have gone in there
		and done something like that?				

Will looks down at the grave, then at the others - 

				WILL
		We'll never know for sure. 

				SEAMUS
		Hopefully the whole sad
		chapter is over.  And everyone,
		including your family, will
		find peace. 
				WILL
		I just want to...thank all of
		you, for everything you've done
		for us.

				MAURA
		Yes.  We'd like to have you over
		for dinner.  Give a sense of 
		closure to the whole thing.
		You too, father.

Seamus looks at Will and Maura - 

				WILL
		Yes.  It would mean a lot to 
		both of us.

The father considers for a beat, then smiles -

		You've done your homework, Mrs.
		South.

				MAURA
		Maura.
			
				SHEA
		Maura.

				MAURA
		Yeah, they told us this was 
		the best.

Shea nurses his glass - 

				SHEA
		There's nothing like a nice 
		single malt to warm the bones.

Maura gives a glass to Seamus - 
				MAURA
		Father.

Seamus takes the glass - 

				SEAMUS
		One good drink before dinner.

He raises his glass - 

				SEAMUS
		Here's mud in your eye.

The men take sips of their whiskey - 

Maura then turns and looks in the direction of the dining room - 

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Will sets the table -  

Amy approaches - 

				AMY
		Do you need help with anything?

Will and Amy look at each other for a beat - 

				WILL
		Oh no, thank you.  Everything's
		pretty much under control.

Amy looks around the dining room - 

				AMY
		I have to admit you really have
		a beautiful home.

				WILL
		Thank you.  If you told me two
		years ago we'd be living here, I
		would never have believed it.
			(Beat)
		Do you live around here?

				AMY
		No, I live about in Wexford.  It's
		about a five hour drive.


				WILL
		How did you meet Dr. Shea?

				AMY
		There were a series of lectures
		about parapsychology at my
		university.  I went and heard
		him speak, and became
		fascinated with the idea of
		hunting ghosts.

				WILL
		I have to admit I was skeptical.
			(Beat)
		Until now.

				AMY
		So was I.  The usual investigation 
		turns up nothing more times than
		not.

				WILL
		Well, I guess this whole thing was
		as strange for you as it was for
		us.

				AMY
		Yes.  It was.

Will and Amy look at each other for a beat - there is an  underlying attraction between the two of
them - 

Just then Maura enter the room - 

				MAURA
		How are we doing?

				WILL
		I think everything's ready.

				MAURA
		Good.  I'll start bringing things

Maura looks at Will and Amy, then head into the kitchen - 

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Aubrey wears her bathrobe and looks around the hallway before entering her room -



INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Aubrey enters the room, looks around - 

She sees her dolls, looking at her - 

She sits on her bed - the storm rages outside - she looks out the window apprehensively - 

				MAURA(O.S.)
		Aubrey, come on down and have
		some dinner!

				AUBREY
		Ok...

Aubrey looks around the room - 

				AUBREY
		Colleen? 

There is no response - 

				AUBREY
		Colleen, are you there?

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Amy, Shea, Seamus and Will sit down at the table - Maura comes in with the turkey - 

				SHEA
		I'm hungry enough to eat a
		horse.

				MAURA
		You'll have to settle for turkey.

				AMY
		It looks delicious...

				WILL
			(to Amy)
		Why don't you pass me your 
		plate?

Amy passes her plate to Will, who puts it near Maura - Maura proceeds to carve the turkey - 


				MAURA
		Will, will you call Aubrey
		again?

Will gets up and heads toward the stairs offscreen - 

				WILL
		Aubrey!  Come on down.

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Aubrey stares at something with a hypnotized expression, as if she wants to scream but can't - 

We see what she is staring at - the ghostly apparition of MARION, the woman in the painting - it
stares back at Aubrey with ashen skin and sunken cheeks - the two stand and stare at one another - 

Marion takes a few steps closer, ever so slowly - 

Slowly, she offers Aubrey her hand - Aubrey takes a few steps back, shivering and mute with terror
- 

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Maura continues to carve the turkey - 

				MAURA
		Is white meat all right for you,
		Mr. Shea?

knife as blood spatters the others - 

EXT MANOR - NIGHT

A tremendous BOLT OF LIGHTNING SMASHES the house - 

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone cowers as the house goes dark and plates and glasses are SWEPT off the table, smashing
against the wall - 

Father Seamus is BLASTED backward, slamming his head against the wall and falling unconscious - 

Strange noises begin to emanate from the house, agonized moans and screams of suffering - things
continue to fly around the room - 

Will covers Maura as they struggle to get their bearing - 

The windows HURL themselves open as the furious wind sends things blowing about the room - 

INT FOYER - NIGHT



In the deafening chaos Shea fumbles in the dark through his equipment until he finds a powerful
FLASHLIGHT - his trembling hands fumble to get it to light - 

And just then there is a flash of LIGHTNING - Shea looks up to see the shadow of the BLACK
CREATURE leering at him for a split second and then SMASH - the window BURSTS into a million
pieces - 

Shea crashes back against the wall screaming, his face bloodied with shards of glass - 

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Amy dives for cover under a desk as the house shakes - she
sees Father Seamus lying there, unconscious, and crawls over to him - 

Lights rapidly go on and off, bulbs EXPLODE -

Objects continue to fly around - the moaning persists - 
Maura and Will look up - 

				MAURA
			(frantic)
		Aubrey...Aubrey!

Maura gets up and runs toward Aubrey's room - Will follows her -   

Shea staggers to his feet, and BOLTS toward the front door - 

Kneeling over Seamus, Amy turns to see Shea flee - 

				AMY
		Shea!  Shea!

Just then a KNIFE from the dinner table FLIES across the room - 

It SLASHES Amy's arm - she screams and falls backwards -

Shea flees the house, tripping and falling through the mud and the rain toward his CAR -

Bloodied and soaked, Shea struggles to navigate - 

He sees something up ahead - 

POV it is the ghostly white apparition of MARION standing in the middle of the road as Shea
rapidly approaches - 
Shea SLAMS on the brakes - 

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Shea's car SPINS violently as it passes through the apparition - 

The violently out-of-control vehicle SPINS and - 

SMASHES head on into a tree, killing Shea instantly - 

We see Shea's bloody, mangled body, pinned inside the vehicle on the desolate road - 

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Will stands back and SMASHES the door with his foot - he does it again and again until finally the
door starts to give - 

INT AUBREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A DRESSER blocks Will from getting in, which he furiously shoves out of his way - 

				WILL
		Aubrey!

Will and Maura rush into the room -

		Oh my God where is she!

				MAURA
		She's gone! 

				WILL
		Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!

		Aubrey!

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 	

Will and Maura rush in as Amy comes in with a candle - 

				AMY
		Did you find her?!

				WILL
		No!

				MAURA
		The cellar!

Will and Maura rush toward the direction of the cellar - 

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Will rushes over to the cellar door - he rips it open - 
Maura and Will are met with a blinding WALL of swirling LIGHT and COLOR - 

Amy watches on in horror, light reflecting off of them - 

Father Seamus comes to, gets his bearings - 

Will and Maura stare at the light as a low strange demonic voice mutters something indecipherable
- then - 

WHAM!  Will and Maura are blown back off their feet as the cellar door slams shut - 

Will comes to his senses and charges the door again - this time it does not budge - he slams it
again and again and again - 
				WILL
		Aubrey!  Aubrey!



				MAURA
			(hysterical)
		My God what is it?

Strange sounds continue to emanate from the house - 

BEAMS OF LIGHT emit through the cracks of the cellar door - 

Out of breath and drenched in sweat Will looks at Maura then around the house - 


				WILL
		This isn't happening...

				SEAMUS(O.S.)
		The amulet...

Will turns in the direction of Seamus - 

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Will enters with Maura -  Amy looks at Seamus, who stands 
up - 

				SEAMUS
		...where is it?

				SHEA
		What?

				SEAMUS
		Where have you put the amulet?

Will approaches Seamus - 

				WILL
		What...amulet?

				SEAMUS
		Did you remove anything in the
		cellar!




				WILL
		Yes...
			(Beat)
		How do you know about that?

Seamus looks at Will for a beat - 

				SEAMUS
		I was the one who put it there.

Will says nothing -

				SEAMUS
		Your daughter's been taken.

				MAURA
		What!

Seamus looks at all of them with a grave expression - 

				SEAMUS
		I said nothing before, for fear you
		wouldn't believe me.
			(Beat)
		I've been here before to cast evil
		from this house.  The amulet is
		a guard against evil, blessed in
		countless rituals.   It is an
		ancient ceremony of the early
		Catholic church, a ceremony whose 
		secrets are all but lost. 
		
				WILL
		So what does that have to do with
		Aubrey!  Where is she!

				SEAMUS
		We must return it, if you want 
		your daughter back.

				WILL
		What are you getting at!

				SEAMUS
		I said nothing before, for fear you
		wouldn't believe me.  
			(Beat)
		I've exorcised forces from this house.  
		Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants 
		another soul, the one we've taken 
		away. We must weaken it!

Seamus approaches Will and Maura - 

				SEAMUS
		Aubrey may be in grave danger!  
		Where is the amulet!

Amy rushes over to a BAG containing Shea's equipment - she opens the bag and pulls out the amulet -

Amy approaches Seamus and hands him the amulet - 

Seamus takes it, looks to Maura - 

				SEAMUS
		I'm going to need a hammer, 
		some nails, a candle and a 
		pin.

Will heads off to get the items - Seamus looks at Maura - 

				SEAMUS
		I'm going to need some other 
		things.  Some pearls, and onyx.

Maura begins to head off but looks at Seamus in hesitation - 

				MAURA
		I don't have any onyx.

Amy takes off her ring - 

				AMY
		I do.


CLOSE on a piece of PAPER - the onyx stone drops to the paper -

Seamus proceeds to SMASH the onyx, crushing it, as Maura hands him some pearl earrings -  

Will and Amy watch as Seamus then puts the pearls and onyx on a piece of paper and begins to smash
them up -

				AMY
		Where does this amulet come from?

				SEAMUS
		It's origin is unknown.  The symbol
		does correspond  to a dagger I
		acquired many years ago.

Seamus turns and looks at Amy and Will - 

				SEAMUS
		The dagger is used to free those
		possessed if stabbed directly
		into the heart, according to 
		ancient beliefs - 

				AMY
		By killing them?

				SEAMUS
		By freeing them.

				AMY
		I don't understand.

				SEAMUS
		The knife destroys the evil
		and saves the soul of the
		possessed.

Shea watches Seamus mix the ingredients - 

				AMY
		What do these ingredients mean?

				SEAMUS
			(trance-like)	
		Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity...
		Onyx is the sickle, death...

Seamus takes the AMULET and nails it to the wall - 

Seamus then takes the crushed ingredients and pours them into the top of a large CANDLE filled
with liquid wax...

				SEAMUS
		As I said, only fragments of ritual
		exist.  Of what I know, this is the
		procedure.  It seems to have suppressed
		the forces of evil, if not removed
		them altogether... 

Seamus then looks at Amy and Maura - 

				SEAMUS
		I'm going to need some blood.  It
		must be from a woman.

				MAURA
		Why?

				SEAMUS
		The blood of a woman is birth, life.
		It is part of the ceremony.
Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes 
it - 

				WILL
		How long will it take!

				SEAMUS
		It will not take long...

Maura takes the pin and PRICKS her finger - she winces as the blood rises -

Maura heads over to the candle - lets the blood drip out into the wax - 

Just then WHAM!  The front door flies open and a strong wind blows the candles out, immersing the
group in darkness - 

Will lights the candle again -  

Seamus then approaches the amulet on the wall and pours the dripping contents over the amulet - 

The house is RATTLED by loud thumping and screams - Seamus puts the candle down and addresses Will
and Maura - 

				SEAMUS
		Now you must listen to me. This force 
		is like a parasite, or a virus. It 
		feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord...
		you must clear your mind as we
		reach out for her.	
	
				MAURA
		So what should we do, father?
			
Seamus looks at Maura - 

				SEAMUS
		You have to lead her out.
			(to Will)
		Come over here...

Amy watches as Will approaches - Seamus takes Maura's hand and places it on Will's - he then looks
at Will - 

				SEAMUS
		Talk to her, and remove her
		fear...only she can cross over.
		
Maura and Will hesitate - 

				SEAMUS
		Go ahead.  I believe right now
		she may hear you.

				MAURA
			(Beat)
		Aubrey?  It's mommy.

The group waits - 

				MAURA
		Aubrey?  Can you hear me!

Then, over the twisted, distorted sounds, almost imperceptibly - 

				AUBREY(V.O.)
		Help me!  Please!!!

				SHEA
		My God, I heard something!

				WILL
		We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't
		be afraid.  We want you to come
		back to us...

				AUBREY(V.0.)		
		It's dark!  I can't breathe!

				MAURA
		Don't be afraid of it honey.  It's
		just like a bad dream.  Listen to
		us...

Suddenly the lights FLICKER - the telephone FLIES off the desk - 

				SEAMUS
		Keep talking!

				WILL
		It can't hurt you if you're not
		afraid Aubrey.  Think about us.
		We're here for you, we love you...

Odd THUMPING and slamming rattle through the house - Seamus looks around, as does Amy - 

				AUBREY(O.S.)
		I can't move!

				WILL
		Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it
		back as hard as you can!

The lights flicker - there is no reply  -

				MAURA
		Aubrey are you still there!

Soon things begin to fly across the room -


Seamus looks directly at Maura - 

				SEAMUS
		Concentrate!  She can hear you!

				MAURA
		Come back to us honey, don't be
		afraid!

The window flies open - wind blows through the room - 

Then, much louder and clearer than before - 

				AUBREY(V.O.)
		Mommy please help me!

				WILL
		Don't be afraid!

				AUBREY(V.O.)
		Daddy, please!!!

Seamus looks at Maura - 

				SEAMUS
		She's coming back.  Keep
		talking!

				MAURA
		Come back to us honey!

The noises in the house get louder - everyone looks around - and then suddenly - 

All noise ceases - then a loud CRASH in the hallway - 



Everyone looks at everyone else - then, from somewhere in the house, the muted but distinct sound
of Aubrey 
SCREAMING - 

				AUBREY(V.O.)
		Help!!

Will and Maura realize its from the cellar - they run toward it - 

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

The cellar door HANGS askew - Will and Maura head down the stairs - 

INT CELLAR - NIGHT

Will approaches the screaming - it comes from BEHIND THE WALL, the same patched-up spot where
Colleen was 
discovered - 

Amy heads down the stairs with a candle - 

Seamus watches at the top of the stairs - 

Will feels the wall in horror - 

				WILL
		Oh my God!  She's in there!

				AUBREY
		Daddy help!

Maura looks at Will with a panicked expression as Will lifts up a SLEDGE HAMMER - 

				WILL
		All right Aubrey look out!
		Be careful!

Will then proceeds to SMASH away at the freshly cemented wall with all his might - 

Maura and Amy watch as Will begins to shatter the cement - he clears some away - crouches down - 

Suddenly Aubrey's dirty, scratched ARM pokes out through the hole - 

				AUBREY
		Daddy!

Maura begins to cry as Will grabs Aubrey hand for a beat - 

				WILL
		It's all right baby, just stay
		back!  Cover your eyes!

Will continues to smash away the concrete - 

As he yanks the final piece away - 

Aubrey JUMPS OUT, hugging Will for dear life - 

				AUBREY
		Daddy I'm scared!

Maura hugs Will and Aubrey, crying and kissing Aubrey's 
face -

				MAURA
		My angel!

				AUBREY
		I'm scared!

				WILL
		It's all right...it's all right.
		Shhh...

Amy looks on with a haggard expression and lets out a deep sigh of exhaustion -

		Yes it is.
Will and Seamus look at each other -

				SEAMUS
		I didn't do anything...God saved

		What's going to happen?

				SEAMUS
		I wish I had an answer.

		Well, I want to thank you.

Seamus nods -

				SEAMUS
		Take care of the girl.

		Take care of your family.  They
		are important.

		Yes, they are.

Seamus looks at Will -

		Well, you know where to reach me.
		The church is a stone's throw away
		if you want to come to mass.

Seamus nods at Will - the two men look at each other for a beat, then Seamus walks away into the

looks exhausted to the point of unhealthy - 

An ashen-faced Amy collects some of her equipment - a makeshift BANDAGE is tied around her arm - 

Will approaches Amy - 

				WILL
		Are you all right?

				AMY
		A few years older, perhaps.

				WILL
		How's your arm?

The two look at each other for a beat - 

				AMY
		It will heal.

				WILL
		I'm sorry.

				AMY
		There's no need to be.		

Amy closes her bag - 

				AMY
		Well I suppose I should go.

Amy looks at Maura and Aubrey - Maura looks at her - 

				AMY
		Good-bye.  
			(Beat)
		Good luck.

Maura nods, and Amy follows Will toward the front door -

Maura stares at Will and Amy as she strokes Aubrey's hair - 

Amy then extends her hand - Will grabs it -

paler -

		You ok?

Maura nods - 

				AUBREY
		Are we going back to California
		daddy?

		Well, that all depends.

Will lies down on the bed, looks at Aubrey, then at Maura - 

				WILL
		What do you think we should do?


				MAURA
		Maybe you have a reason to stay 
		here.

The statement surprises Will - 

				WILL
		It doesn't matter to me.  
			(Beat)
		What do you mean by that?

				MAURA
		You seem to appreciate the local
		scenery.

Will scrutinizes Maura's face - 

				WILL
		You don't look too well, Maura.
		Do you feel ok?
				MAURA
		What's wrong with the way I look?

Will approaches Maura and gently feels her head - 

				WILL
		Maybe you're getting a fever.

Maura brushes Will's hand aside - 

				MAURA
		I'm fine.

				WILL
		Ok...

Will sits down on the other side of the bed, then turns and looks to Maura -

				SEAMUS(V.O.)
		It is real and I have seen it in
		many forms and many disguises...
		the human evil is self-evident in
		this world, but there are other
		purer forms belonging to the vapor
		and the darkness...

Will picks up the book - 

				SEAMUS(V.O.)
		This evil swallows up innocence
		and light, feeds on violence 
		and human fear...the girl is in
		danger...I have seen this again
		and again...nothing in this world
		can overcome that evil - 

Will seems to concentrate on the next part - 

				SEAMUS(O.S.)
		...save for the power of holy 
		unconditional love, for that 
		is the one force it can never
		defeat...this I have discovered.
		Should the force return, I fear
		more drastic measures may be
		necessary - I don't know if they,
		or I, will have the strength...
