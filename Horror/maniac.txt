Maniac (1934)

 
1 	Meirschultz laboratory-- 
	cabinet in background. Oper-
	ating table in semi-foreground. 
	Table containing apparatus--
	some strange-looking paraphana-
	lia which might remind one of 
	vivisectionist--overhead light 
	on table--rest of room dim and 
	eerie-looking. Two practical 
	hypodermics.
 
2	Dr. Meirschultz is working on 
	table, testing hypodermics with 
	back to audience (side view) and 
	doing business with instruments.
 
	He holds hypo to light and ad-
	dresses his assistant.
 
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						Tonight, my dear Maxwell, I 
						am ready to try my experi-
						ment on a human.
 
 	Maxwell is a bit alarmed.
 
							MAXWELL
						Yes?
 
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						At the morgue, there is a 
						[lethal] gas suicide--an ideal 
						specimen.
 
	Maxwell is surprised; runs 
	hand thru his hair.

							MAXWELL 
						Have you made arrangements?
 
	We see Meirschultz' face for the 
	first time--rather typical, half-
	mad scientist--mussed gray 
	hair--very penetrating eyes--
	beard.
 
3  	Shows his eyes as 
	he says "prying 
	eyes."
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						(very sharp) No! You know I 
						do not work under prying 
						eyes.
 	Very contemptuous.
						You will find a way for me to 
						work without detection. It is 
						your chance to show your 
						gratitude for my generosity 
						and protection.

 
	Maxwell is excited at the 
	queer look in Meirschultz' 
	eye.
							MAXWELL 
						I will never forget what you 
						have done for me and will do 
						anything to help you--but the 
						morgue--dead people--sup-
						pose we should be caught?
 
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						How many times have you 
						told me of your imperson-
						ations--that you never had a 
						chance.

4  	Meirschultz drums on table.

	Craftily.
						Maybe your art will serve you 
						after all.  You have seen the 
						coroner. Why not impersonate
						him?--That's it! 
	Seeing Maxwell succumbing.
						Impersonate him. The time 
						has come when you can repay 
						me for what I have done.

 
5 	Max is agitated and 
	seems afraid of the doctor.
							MAXWELL 
						It's horrible, I tell you!
 						Working on the dead; trying to 
						bring back life. 
	Max is excited.
						It's not natural-- you 
						with your weird ideas! Haven't 
						I stayed here and nursed dying 
						dogs--and--
	Notices Satan.
						--even that miserable cat. 
						And for what--for a measly 
						roof and food. Because you 
						took me in when I was down 
						and out!

6 	CUT to Satan, gazing at him.
 
7	The doctor glares at Maxwell, 
	who seems to cringe under the 
	spell of the doctor's eyes.
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						Once a ham, always a ham. 
						You, an actor! And don't for-
						get, my dear Maxwell, the 
						police will be glad to find you.
	Max is very contrite--smiles 
	wanly. Clears his throat.
							MAXWELL 
						Hm--I did not mean I 
						wouldn't--
 
	Meirschultz is satisfied--
	but half sarcastically--
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						Of course not. In time you 
						may be a great man.
 
				FADE OUT
 
8 	FADE IN the morgue--very 
	dark. Several sheeted tables 
	with supposed corpses under-
	neath sheets.
 
	One, in foreground, is that of 
	a frail, beautiful girl. Meirschultz 
	has a case and Max is looking down 
	in guise of coroner--very dignified 
	--looks entirely different than 
	earlier scene. Has extreme at-
	mosphere of confidence about him.
 
9 	CUT to cat pouncing on rat
	and eating it.
 
10  	TWO SHOT--Meirschultz
	hands his case to Maxwell--
	whispers
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						This is the one--here.
 	Maxwell, papers in hand, 
	reads--
							MAXWELL 
						File No. 26941--Maria 
						Altura--24--suicide--carbon 
						monoxide gas--not claimed.

11	He shudders involuntarily
	as he watches--looks about him.
 
12	Meirschultz opens case--
	takes out hypos--looks at them 
	--gets air bubble out--gives one 
	from each into neck of girl.
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						Perfect--we will have to work 
						fast.
	He then starts a series of 
	manipulations--massages 
	abdomen in region of heart--
	raises arms--works arms.
 
13  	Maxwell watches, then notices 
	that girl is rather good-looking 
	--starts working with arms.
 
14	Meirschultz puts stethoscope 
	to heart--works more rapidly.
	He is very tense--and excited. 
	Use every effort to build up 
	tenseness.
 
 	Finally, a faint sigh from the 
	girl--then
 
15 	CU of slight drool from the 
	mouth. This is all to let the 
	audience know she is faintly 
	alive.
 							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						I must get her out of here--
						she must have oxygen.

16  	Max is astounded at the signs
	of life. He seems pretty awestruck.
	He then looks at the girl. 
	This look decides him to
	brazen it out.
 
 	Meirschultz continues.
						Unlock the side door. Then 
						get the cart--but watch [out] 
						for the guard. Get him out 
						of the way and we'll take her 
						out.
 
17  	TWO EMBALMERS are working
	on a body and notice Meir-
	schultz and Maxwell working 
	on Maria.
							1ST EMBALMER 
						By gosh, them stiffs are get-
						tin' heavier and more of 'em 
						every day. They even got the 
						coroner working overtime.
 
							2ND EMBALMER 
						Yeah, between the gangsters 
						and the autos, we won't need 
						another war to carry off the 
						population.
 
							1ST EMBALMER 
						You didn't even mention the 
						suicides. Did you notice the 
						beaut that came in today?
 
							2ND EMBALMER 
						Did I?
 
							1ST EMBALMER 
						That's the one that's got the 
						coroner doing nightwork.
 
							2ND EMBALMER 
						What--special autopsy?
 
19
							1ST EMBALMER 
						[Guess so.] Must be. I wonder 
						who that old Santa Claus is?
 
20	Meirschultz laboratory. 
	Max and Meirschultz come 
	thru door of room off lab 
	where they have left Maria. 
	Meirschultz looks thought-
	ful but agitated.
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						With twenty-four hours com-
						plete rest, she will recover.
 	Maxwell, thoughtful, seems 
	a bit awestruck.
							MAXWELL 
						Think of it--life back in a 
						body that sought oblivion. It's 
						uncanny--the possibilities 
						terrify me.
	Meirschultz is excited by
	Maxwell's speech.
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						Not a word of this out. This is 
						only a step. Cases like this 
						have an element of doubt. I 
						want a victim with a shattered 
						heart. Yes, a heart--that can 
						be replaced by this beating 
						thing I have forced life back 
						into. Now for my supreme 
						accomplishment. Maxwell you 
						will get me such a victim.

21	CUT TO CU heart beating 
	in bottle.
 
22 	TWO SHOT
							MAXWELL 
						Not from the morgue. They'll 
						get suspicious.
	Meirschultz grows more 
	excited.
							MEIRSCHULTZ 
						I don't care where you get it! 
						From the morgue, the street--
						the undertaker! But get one! 
						(whispers) The end will just-
						ify the means.

23  	Maxwell at door. He is 
	alarmed at the doctor's 
	eyes and excitement and 
	decides to be on his way.
 
24 	CU Max at door.

	Thinks out loud.
							MAXWELL 
						The undertaker around the 
						corner. That gangster shot 
						today. Just the thing.
 
25 	LS Exterior Robinson's 
	mortuary on Washington 
	Street. Just a large, brown 
	house, with sign. Shoot 
	down to basement window.
 
26	A basement window-- 
	Maxwell opens it and 
	climbs in very stealthily.
 
27 	Interior basement mortuary.
	Complete darkness, except 
	beam from small window 
	shining on hazy outline of 
	table with stiff on it.
 
28	CU Max tiptoing to table, 
	his figure rather crouched 
	and looking very fearful.
 
29	CU Maxwell's head--
	glances around as if he 
	fears a presence.
 
30 	CUT to cat fight outside--
	one cat runs and other follows.
 
31	They jump thru basement window.
 
32	They scoot across floor under 
	Maxwell's legs--frightening 
	him so he knocks over body 
	with frightful clatter and he 
	dashes out of the basement.
 
33	Street from mortuary to 
	Meirschultz--Maxwell is 
	running as if pursued.
 
34 	Meirschultz' lab--Maxwell 
	enters excitedly. His expres-
	sion is one of fear and terror.
 
	Impatiently.
							MEIRSCHULTZ
						Where is it?
 	Very breathless and excited.
							MAXWELL 
						(gasps) I--couldn't get--it--
 
35	CU face of Meirschultz--he 
	is very angry and glares at 
	Maxwell contemptuously.
							MEIRSCHULTZ
						Coward--
 
36	Then Meirschultz cools off 
	and paces up and down with 
	Maxwell watching as if not 
	knowing what might happen.
 
	Suddenly, Meirschultz stops 
	in front of Maxwell.
						You fool! You have failed me 
						in the greatest moment of my 
						life!
 	Then Meirschultz goes on 
	walking. Maxwell still watches, 
	fascinated (build up).
 
37 	CU Meirschultz' hands taking 
	gun from drawer as we hear 
	his voice.
						I have it! You have seen my 
						powers. You have worked 
						with me! You have faith in 
						me!
 
38  	TWO SHOT--Meirschultz 
	hands gun to Maxwell.
						Take this--take your life. I 
						will give it back to you. You 
						know I can! 
	Meirschultz is exultant.
						My beating heart shall live 
						in your body--think of it--
 
39  	Gleam appears in 
	his eye--CU.
						Live!

40	Maxwell thinks the doctor 
	is mad--takes gun auto-
	matically.
 
41	Turns around and looks at
42 	it, then whisks around facing 
	the doctor, gun pointed.
 
43 	CU hand--fingers pulling 
	trigger.
						(shots)

44	TWO SHOT--Meirschultz falls 
	to floor. Maxwell drops gun, 
	goes over to doctor, looks him 
	over, realizes the doctor is dead.
 
45 	CU Maxwell--whispers on 
	knees, beside body.
							MAXWELL
						Murder! Ugh.
	Slowly the realization dawns 
	on him; his remorse is turned 
	to fear and terror.
						Murderer--and of my bene-
						factor--horrible--how could 
						I?
	Questioning.
						[What will I do? I must bring 
						him back. But can I?] You
						should live--you have so 
						much to give the world. But 
						has he? Why should the 
						unconscious peace of the dead 
						be disturbed? 
	Decisive.
						Isn't the spark that moves 
						the maggot the self-same 
						spark that moves the man? 
						Preserving that spark in 
						the individual is not 
						important. What we do with 
						the spark while we have it 
						is important.
	Conclusive.
						[In Meirschultz, the spark 
						is gone. In Maxwell, it lives.  
						Still, Meirschultz was great. 
						Maxwell was nobody. Meirschultz 
						could bring life back. Why 
						couldn't I?

						Buckley saw that body--if he 
						tells the police--no they 
						wouldn't believe him. Well,] 
						they might--they would 
						search this place--they--
						mustn't--find him dead. I 
						must bring him back. I'll find 
						that formula and use the beat-
						ing heart.

46 	Maxwell goes thru 
	letters and papers 
	before making 
	dash for liberty. 
	Among them, he 
	finds:
 
47 	INSERT:
 
	"By the use of XDSQ formula 
	in injection into spine, violent 
	superadrenal criminals can be 
	made completely docile ...
 
48 	Maxwell.
							MAXWELL 
						The formula for restoring life 
						must be here. [Nothing to 
						bring him back. But--this 
						may come in handy.

 						I'd better hide him.]

49 	Doorbell rings and Maxwell 
	decides to answer it to avert 
	suspicion. He shoves the 
	body into Maria's room.
 
50 	The above formula paper 
	drops on floor.
 
51 	Doctor's waiting room. Max-
	well opens door. A woman is 
	standing there rather excited.

 							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						Dr. Meirschultz, please.

							MAXWELL
						He isn't here.

 	She thinks the doctor is just 
	busy working and will see 
	her if it is important enough.
 
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						That's terrible. It's so very 
						urgent. Will you tell him that 
						Mr. Buckley is having posi-
						tively alarming hallucinations. 
						Why, he thinks he's the orang-
						utang murderer in Poe's "Mur-
						ders of the Rue Morgue." Tell 
						the doctor I must have some 
						definite help.
 
						I'll go get him and bring him 
						back.

	She rushes off.
 
							MAXWELL
						No--No--don't do that--
  
	Mrs. Buckley is out of sight.
 
52 	Maxwell turns--goes back to 
	lab, thinking, locking door 
	before going back.

							MAXWELL 
						Meirschultz would be missed. 
	Inspired.
						Maxwell never would.

	Maxwell glances around 
	and sees makeup case.
 
53 	CUT TO CU makeup case.
 
54 	CUT TO Maxwell with case 
	and then
 
55	CUT TO fades of his changes
	into Meirschultz. Beard, 
	heavy eyebrows, graying 
	hair, etc.
 
56 	When completed, he takes 
	one long look in mirror and 
	swells with pride.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Not only do I look like Meir-
						schultz--I AM Meirschultz. 
						I will be a great man.
 
56a 	CUT TO CU dead Meirschultz,
	eyes staring. Maxwell's 
	hands enter scene and pull
	down the lids.
 
 	FADE OUT
 
57	INSERT: Door--
	"MISSING PERSONS DETAIL 
	Captain H.W. Jones"
 
58	CUT TO Jones' office. 
						(phone rings)
	He is sitting at desk, 
	talking on phone. Two 
	officers lolling about.
 
							JONES (on phone)
						Yes, speaking.
	Puts hand over mouthpiece 
	and motions to one officer.
							(to officer)
 						Take this down.
 
58 	INTERIOR--JONES' OFFICE.
	Coroner, Jones and 1st 
	embalmer--Mike.
 
 	Jones is puzzled.
							JONES 
						You say the corpse of a young 
						woman was stolen.

	Also puzzled.
							CORONER 
						Yes. It sure has me puzzled. 
						Mike thought I took it out.

	Mike quickly 
	tries to justify 
	himself.
 
							MIKE 
						Sure and I would have swore
						it was the coroner himself--
 
							JONES
						There must have been a 
						strong resemblance--?
 
							MIKE 
						The dead image! And talked 
						like him too.
 
							JONES 
						Oh, then you were speaking 
						with the coroner--?

	Quickly explanatory--
							MIKE
						No--He was a-talkin' to an old 
						fella looked like Santa Claus--
						like I said to Jake--
	Mike laughs 
	here like he did in 
	the morgue, then, 
	seeing Jones' stern 
	face breaks off 
	suddenly--  
						Anyway, he had a beard. And 
						busy hair 'n 'n eyes kinda 
						wild. 
	Half to himself--
						It musta been two other 
						fellas.

	Jones thinks of 
	Meirschultz but 
	does not commit 
	himself.
							JONES 
						Could you identify the man if 
						you saw him again?

							MIKE 
						I wouldn't swear to anything 
						now--since I was so sure it 
						was the coroner.
 
	Jones has been 
	thinking and turns 
	to the coroner.

							JONES 
						Mike's description sounds like 
						your friend Meirschultz. Have 
						you seen the doctor lately?

	Belittles this 
	suspicion as of 
	no consequence.
 
							CORONER 
						Whuh, Dr. Meirschultz is a 
						great research scientist. Why, 
						he has formulated some ama-
						zing methods for preserving 
						gland extracts in their most 
						potent state. He's no body
						snatcher.

							JONES
						Well, doctors and scientists 
						often have something queer in 
						their minds. Anyway, I'll look 
						into it.

	Jones rises.

							CORONER 
						Go easy, Jones. I wouldn't 
						like to offend the doctor--

	Ushering them out.
 
							JONES
						Don't worry. I won't embar-
						rass you.
 
	Jones walks back to his 
	desk a bit puzzled. Picks 
	up letter--
 
	Picks up inter-
	office phone and 
	presses buzzer.

							JONES 
						Collins, see if you have any-
						thing on Don Maxwell, last 
						heard from in this city. 
						Impersonations in vaudeville.

	Officer nods assent.

							(into phone) 
						Body of Maria Altura, suicide 
						was stolen from the morgue. 
						Thief impersonated the coro-
						ner. Party with him looked 
						like Dr. Meirschultz. Yes, I'll 
						look into it before anything is 
						done formally.
 
	Hangs up receiver.
 
							(to officer) 
						Boy, that's a hot one--and a 
						new one--it used to be getting 
						rid of the body, but now 
						they're stealing them.
  
59 	CUT TO LAB--Maxwell. 
						(doorbell rings)
	Doorbell rings again. Max 
	peeks to see who it is before 
	opening. He turns the 
	lights low.
 
60 	CUT TO Ext. Doctor's house--Mrs. 
	Buckley ringing bell. Mr. 
	Buckley is with her. Maxwell 
	opens door.
 
61	CUT TO interior office--same 
	door--over Maxwell's shoulder. 

							MRS.BUCKLEY
						Here he is, doctor.

	Max takes it.
 	He invites them in.
 
62 	Office.
							MAXWELL 
						Come in--(to Buckley) You 
						are looking well, Mr. Buckley. 
						What seems to be troubling 
						you?

	Buckley is very 
	sullen.
							BUCKLEY 
						Nothing is troubling me. I 
						seem to be troubling everyone 
						else.

	Maxwell tries to 
	be affable.
							MAXWELL 
						I wouldn't feel that way. Let's 
						talk it over.
	Turns to Mrs. Buckley.
							(to Mrs. Buckley)
						How often does he have these 
						spells?
 
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						They are becoming more fre-
						quent. The last ones have 
						been less than a week apart.
 
							MAXWELL 
						That is bad--let me see. Did 
						we X-ray his head for pituit-
						ary pressure?
 
							MRS. BUCKLEY
						Oh yes. Don't you remember? 
						You suggested operating after 
						you completed your new 
						experiment. But, really, doc-
						tor, I am afraid to wait much 
						longer.
 
	Maxwell is worried about this 
	situation, not wanting to take 
	responsibility.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Well, you know, we hate to 
						operate on these cases. It's so 
						delicate an operation and I 
						have been awfully busy.
 
							(to Buckley) 
						You are willing, of course, to 
						sign the necessary papers that 
						you undergo this operation at 
						your own responsibility.
 
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						Of course, James wants to be 
						cured.

	Buckley is angry.
      						BUCKLEY 
						Who said I did? Always
						scheming to try to get me to 
						sign papers. You're trying to 
						get rid of me--that's what--
 	Soothingly but relieved.
							MAXWELL 
						Now, never mind, Mr.Buckley. 
						Nothing will be done that you 
						are not entirely in accord 
						with.

							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						He always seems to feel some-
						one is trying to take advan-
						tage of him.

	To Buckley he 
	gives a look of 
	appeal as he says
							MAXWELL 
						I'll give him a shot to relieve 
						the nerve tension. It may 
						help him. We'll try that first.

	Maxwell is anxious 
	to get rid of them.
 
63	Meirschultz' lab. Maxwell 
	puts water into hypo. Glances 
	in direction of door with body.
 
64 	CU DOOR
 
65 	Max lays hypo down on 
	table.
							MAXWELL (to himself) 
						Water--that'll do him no 
						harm and I'll be rid of them.
 
66 	CU table, showing hypo laying 
	next to the one used on Maria. 
	Buckley's hypo rolls off on 
	floor. Maxwell's fingers take 
	other hypo.
 
67 	Maxwell with hypo.
							MAXWELL (calls) 
						Come in here, please.
	Buckleys enter.
 
68 	Max bares Buckley's arm 
	and gives him a shot.
     
							MAXWELL 
						There now, you'll feel better--
	His expression 
	grows a little wild. 
							BUCKLEY
						Ugh.

69 	Mrs. Buckley tries to 
	soothe Buckley.
 
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						Don't excite yourself, James. 
						Be calm.
 
70	Instead of growing quieter, 
	Buckley becomes enraged.

							BUCKLEY 
						Slipping. Creeping. It's ter-
						rible.  I can't stand it--
 
71  	Slowly he assumes the
	attitude of ape man.
 
 							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						Doctor, he seems worse 
						instead of better. What was
						in that hypo?
 
72 	Buckley starts to rave, and 
	during this speech becomes 
	ape man.

							BUCKLEY 
						Pouring into my blood--darts 
						of fire stabbing my brain--
						agonizing--I can't stand this 
						--torment--torture--I can't 
						stand it--I won't stand it.

	He runs amuck 
	and begins fight 
	with Mrs. Buckley 
	and Maxwell.
 
 
73  	CUT TO Maria comes thru door,
	stepping over Meirschultz' feet 
	visible thru open door, leaves 
	door open and wanders into 
	laboratory in a daze.
 
74 	Buckley knocks Max over by 
	table and Maxwell sees hypo 
	on floor.
 
75 	CU Max sees hypo.
 
							MAXWELL 
						What was in that hypo?
 
76 	Buckley throws Mrs. Buckley
	across room by open door 
	where body is. He spies 
	Maria, grabs her and leaves 
	the room.
 
77 	Mrs. Buckley bending over 
	Meirschultz body. She looks 
	up, horrified.
 
	Very excited.
 							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						What's this? He's dead! [Call 
						the police!] Doctor, what have 
						you done? This looks like 
						murder.
 
78  	Max is agitated. He feels
 	he will be undone completely.
 
							MAXWELL 
						No, no--not murder--my 
						assistant--he shot himself.
 
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						Shot himself? When? Why I 
						just saw him an hour ago. 
						Why didn't you call the 
						police?
 
	Maxwell thinks fast 
	and talks jerkily.
							MAXWELL 
						No, not the police. I wanted to 
						bring him back to life. I 
						wanted to experiment on him. 
						In fact, I must. I can restore 
						him.

79	Mrs. Buckley looks 
	accusingly, then 
	picks up paper 
	Max had dropped.
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						You murdered your assistant, 
						just to experiment on him.

80	Reads paper. 
 
 						Dr. Meirschultz, I've often 
						heard of your uncanny exper-
						iments, but this tops them all. 
						But, I think we speak the 
						same language--am I right?
 
							MAXWELL 
						Well, I don't know just what 
						you mean--the same language.
 
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						We have a common interest. 
						When you bring your assistant 
						back to life, his mind will do
						as you direct. You can do 
						that to Buckley too--
	To herself says:
						And he will do as I direct.
 
81	She picks up telephone.
							MAXWELL 
						What are you going to do?
 
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						I'm going to call the police.
 
							MAXWELL 
						No, you can't do that--they'll 
						get suspicious--
 
      						MRS.BUCKLEY 
						Hm--with Buckley loose, 
						they'll get suspicious if we 
						don't call them.
 
82 	Mrs. Buckley telephones.
 
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						Police Department? This is 
						Dr. Meirschultz' office. An 
						epileptic patient just escaped 
						while here for treatment. 
	Maxwell listens 
	to her explana-
	tion with wonder.
						He imagines himself a monkey. 
						He may frighten people ... 
						Please notify me immediately 
						... oh, no, he isn't dangerous.
 
83  Hangs up phone.

							MAXWELL 
						Why did you tell them that? 
						You know he is dangerous!
	Mrs. Buckley is still angry.
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						The police will notify you as 
						soon as they capture him ... 
						Now, it's up to you to get him 
						away from the police without 
						arousing suspicion.
 
	Maxwell becomes alarmed. 
	They are closing in on him. 
	The police are involved.
 
	Mrs. Buckley leaves, saying
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						As soon as they call, let me 
						know.
 
84 	After she is gone, Maxwell 
	inspects the body--looks at 
	heart.
 
85	CU heart in bottle.
 
86
							MAXWELL 
						Buckley saw that body. The 
						police--if they come--I must 
						bring him back. I must find 
						that formula.
 
87 	Goes to papers and digs out 
	notations at last on restor-
	ing life. He reads intently.
 
	INSERT: formula
 
88	OUTER OFFICE--waiting room. 
	Goof at door to see doctor. 
	Sound of bell.
 
							GOOF 
						Howdy do, Doctor. A couple
						of my cats got away--did ya 
						see 'em?

							MAXWELL 
						Why, of course not. What 
						would I want with your cats.
 
							GOOF 
						I knew ya didn't want 'em. 
						Still, I thought ya mighta used 
						'em for some experiments.

							MAXWELL 
						Me-cats-never-oh-ah-
	Unconsciously 
	he looks quest-
	ioning--Then 
	recovering 
						That is, I think too much of 
						Satan to use cats for experi-
						ments.

							GOOF 
						That's what I thought. No 
						harm meant, doctor--

	Goof leaves.
 
89	CUT TO Satan sneaking along 
	and dragging out heart and 
	starting to eat it.
 
89a 	Maxwell returns and discovers
	Satan devouring the heart.
 
							MAXWELL 
						What am I going to do. The 
						police will be here any minute. 
						I must dispose of the body. 
						I'll hide it--I'll burn it--no, I 
						can't do that--ah, the basement.
 
90 	BASEMENT. Maxwell is
	looking for a spot to hide 
	the body.

91  	CU niche in brick wall.
 
92 	He tears a few bricks out.
 
93 	Turns to go back upstairs 
	and sees Satan watching 
	him--the gleam appears 
	in Satan's eyes.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Satan--the gleam--you vic-
						ious wretch! Stand between 
						me and salvation, will you--
 
94 	Maxwell lunges at cat, think-
	ing the cat has Meirschultz' 
	eyes and gouges one eye out.
						(yowls of cat)

94a 	CU eye in his hand.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Why, it's not unlike an oyster 
						--or a grape--(smiles--
						laughs) 
	Perplexed.
						But the gleam is gone.
 
95 	Satan jumps thru window.
 
96	LABORATORY--Maxwell

102 	Jones' office. Jones at desk.
	Buckley is brought in by an 
	officer.
 
							OFFICER 
						Picked him up stealing food. 
						Seems to be a little off. 
						Hated to lock him up till you 
						had a look at him.
 
	Buckley acts very sullen 
	thru all this scene.
 
							JONES (to Buckley) 
						What's the matter? Are you 
						ill?
 
							BUCKLEY 
						No-

							JONES
 						Who are you? What is your 
						name?
 
							BUCKLEY 
						I don't know, [I tell you].
 
	Phone rings.

102a	Jones picks up phone.
 
	Show various facial expres-
	sions during this conversation 
	to put this over.
							JONES 
						Yes ... hmm ... You say 
						she hasn't been dead an 
						hour? Send up the officer 
						that brought her in.

	Hangs up phone.
 
102b
							JONES 
						What made you steal? Are 
						you hungry?
 
							BUCKLEY 
						No--I don't want to give any 
						money. Everybody wants 
						money--I'm not going to give 
						any money.
 
							JONES
						Who wants your money--
						maybe I can help you.
 
							BUCKLEY 
						Maybe you want my money, 
						too.

	Very friendly.
							JONES
						No, I don't want money. I 
						only want to find out who 
						you are and where you live. 
						My business is finding peo-
						ple. Not taking their money.
 
							BUCKLEY 
						You--a friend to me?
 
							JONES
						Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. 
						--what?
 
							BUCKLEY 
						I don't know--I can't tell--

	Jones indicates pencil 
	and paper on desk.

							JONES
						Try him writing. Amnesia 
						victims will often write what 
						they can't say.

103 	Excited.
							OFFICER 
						Mr. Jones, I have news about 
						that corpse.

	Jones motions for 
	him to be quiet.
 
							JONES (to officer)
						Just a moment--

104	To Buckley.
						How would you like to write 
						some spelling for me? Maybe 
						I can help you. Sit down and 
						write what I tell you--will 
						you?
 
	Buckley responds to Jones' 
	very human treatment.
 
105							BUCKLEY 
						[Oh--all right.] (Mumbles--)
 
							JONES
						Write "boy," "school," 
						"house," "home," "father," 
						"his name," "born," "my 
						name is--"
  
	Buckley writes all these words
	but when it comes to his name 
	he writes "James--Chicago," 
	then stops short.
 
	Officer enters room.
							BUCKLEY 
						No, no! I won't sign any pa-
						pers. You can't make me--
 
							JONES 
						Hm--pressure--
	To Buckley. 
						That's all right. We'll talk 
						later.

	To officer.
						Let him rest.
	To 2nd officer.
						So, you found the body stolen 
						from the morgue?
 
							2ND OFFICER 
						Imagine--she was alive. 
						What a horror. Could have 
						been buried alive. She must 
						have run away from the 
						morgue.
 
							JONES 
						Never mind your theories. 
						Was she ever conscious?
 
							2ND OFFICER 
						Just before she died she came 
						to--
 
							JONES
						Did she talk?
 
							2ND OFFICER
						Said "doctor"--[something]
 
							JONES 
						[Was it] "Meirschultz"?
 
							[2ND OFFICER 
						How did you know?]
 
106 	Buckley jumps at the name. 
	Seems to be going into 
	another spell. He looks 
	terrible.

107							BUCKLEY 
						Dr. Meirschultz--he's the 
						one-

	Jones is alarmed. 
	Buckley starts 
	turning to ape man.

							JONES
 						Tell me, just what you know 
						of Dr. Meirschultz.
 
							BUCKLEY 
						Papers--they all want me to 
						sign papers.
 
							JONES 
						Dr. Meirschultz, too?

108	Buckley is very excited 
	and starts to have spell.
							BUCKLEY 
						Yes--I can't stand it--
						everybody wants papers--
						oh, oh (starts to growl)
 
							JONES 
						Take him to the psychopathic 
						hospital.

 	Officers take Buckley out, 
	leaving Jones alone.
 
							JONES (to himself) 
						It looks as though I'd better 
						look in at Dr. Meirschultz.
 
109	EXTERIOR neighborhood of lab. 
	Collins walks down street and 
	encounters woman sweeping off 
	front steps. Collins stops.
 
							COLLINS 
						Do you know a Dr. Meir-
						schultz and his assistant,
						Don Maxwell?
 
110 	Woman stops sweeping and 
	leans on broom.
 
							WOMAN 
						Sure--they're sorta queer, 
						I'd say. They's lots of queer 
						goings on up there. They 
						even brought a dog back to 
						life once.
 
							COLLINS 
						That sounds to me very 
						remarkable.
 
							WOMAN 
						It may be, but to my notion, 
						those that monkeys with 
						what they got no business to 
						get queer sooner or later.
 
							COLLINS 
						Maybe you're right. 
     
							WOMAN 
						I know I am. Why, I even 
						heard a shot up there last 
						night.
 
							COLLINS 
						Why didn't you notify the 
						police?
 
	Starts to sweep vigorously.
 
							WOMAN 
						That's their business--not 
						mine.
 
111	EXTERIOR. 
	Jones leaves and goes to 
	cat farm. Goof has bunch 
	of cats around and nods 
	to Jones.
 
							JONES
						I understand from your 
						neighbors that all [them] cats 
						are making noise at night. 
						Dr. Meirschultz has put in a
						complaint.
 
							GOOF 
						He's been stealing my cats to 
						experiment on [them]. I know 
						cause I've been [watching]
						spying on him.
 
							JONES 
						[Lot of] How many cats you 
						have--what's the matter--
						rats?
 
							GOOF 
						Yeah--thousands, and right 
						in my back yard.
 
	Jones takes this.
							JONES
						Thousands?

							GOOF 
						Sure, got thousand cats, too. 
						Look at 'em--
	Points to cages of cats.

	Jones points to 
	Dr.'s house. 
							JONES 
						What' s the idea [of wanting so 
						many] do you sell them [to 
						the doctor]?
 
							GOOF 
						Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm 
						in the business. In the fur 
						business.
 
							JONES
						Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
 
							GOOF
						That's it. You get it quick.
 
							JONES 
						But where do the rats come 
						in?
 
							GOOF 
						You're not as quick as I 
						thought. I figgered out that 
						rats breed faster than cats--
						cat skins make good fur--
						The cats eat rats. Rats eat 
						raw meat. That is, they eat 
						the carcasses of the cats. So 
						--the cats eat the rats--the 
						rats eat the cats. And I get 
						the skins--simple ain't it?
 
	Jones is astonished at the 
	Goof's simple logic. 
	(mouths this)
							JONES
 						Cats eat rats--(nods)
	(aloud)
						But, rats eating cats--that's 
						news.
 
						[But, tell me, doesn't the doc-
						tor object to all this?

							GOOF 
						Oh, him. He has a cat of his 
						own. But his assistant--he's 
						the cat-hatenest man I ever 
						saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.] 

							JONES
 						By the way--did you hear a 
						shot last night?

	Scratches his head.
 							GOOF 
						Maybe. I don't know.
 
112 	Jones walks away, 
	shaking his head.
							[JONES 
						If I want any information I'd 
						better go to the doctor him-
						self.]
 
113 	Waiting room (office). 
	Jones with Maxwell.
 
							JONES
						I'm detective Jones. Just 
						dropped in to tell you a bit of 
						news.
 
							MAXWELL 
						You found Buckley?
  
114 	Jones is watching Max closely 
	as he tells the following.
 
							JONES
						Not exactly. He has been 
						seen, though. And not far 
						from here. There is also a 
						report that he has been seen 
						carrying a woman. That's 
						fantastic, though, as no one 
						has reported a woman 
						missing.
 
115 	Maxwell swallows.

							MAXWELL
						That is a mystery.

116	TWO SHOT--observing.

							JONES
 						By the way, where is your 
						assistant?
 
							MAXWELL 
						Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
 
117 	CUT TO INTERIOR--hotel bedroom.
	Four show girls; Alice Maxwell; 
	Marvel, acrobat; Maizie, in bath; 
	Jo;--business with vibrator.
 
							MARVEL 
						Hey, Maizie, we know you're 
						hard boiled. You don't have 
						to stay in the water thirty
						minutes to prove it.
 
							MAIZIE 
						Aw--let me alone. I may 
						not be decent, but I'm sure 
						gonna be clean.

	Alice in vibrator.
							ALICE
						Say, if anyone is entitled to 
						first place in that bathroom,
						it should be me.  Didn't I
						sign the register and welcome 
						you as secret guests? Why, 
						if it wasn't for nervy little 
						Alice--

118	Maizie comes in 
	with towel and 
	grabs kimono.
						you'd all be sinking your 
						weary bones into the soft 
						recesses of a park bench. 
						With light, fleecy coverlets

119 	Maizie takes glass 
	tomato juice from 
	Jo and picks up 
	newspaper.
						made by the great American 
						press.
 
							JO 
						Press--that reminds me. I 
						have pressing business.
 
							MAIZIE 
						Here's one for the book. A 
						sandwich man pounding pave-
						ments. Walks into a wallet 
						with forty-two grand in it.
 
							JO 
						I'd like to find that man--
 
							MARVEL 
						Maybe we could sandwich 
						him in--huh?

120	Marvel leaves for bath.

							MAIZIE 
						Can you imagine--the 
						darned fool turned it in.
 
							MARVEL 
						His head must have been a
 						jelly bean--instead of the 
						way they thought it was.
 
121	Alice stops vibrator.
 
							ALICE 
						Well, it sure was soft, all 
						right. But would it be soft to 
						land on to forty-two grand.
 
122 	TWO SHOT--Maizie and Marvel.

							MAIZIE 
						Yeah--but listen. After he 
						turned it in, people made 
						such a fuss over him that he 
						went "nutty." Thought he 
						was the Almighty in person.
 
							MARVEL 
						So, that's what being honest 
						gets ya. A nice soft padded 
						cell in the bughouse.
 
123 	Alice starts vibrator.
 
							ALICE
						La Cucuracha--la cocka-
						roacha...

124 	Marvel gives Alice a push.
 
							MARVEL 
						[Pushin' all jokes aside.] It is 
						pretty tough. Imagine the 
						poor guy. I'll bet nobody no-
						ticed him all his life. And 
						then--say, wasn't there 
						some guy in history that 
						spent his life looking for an 
						honest man?

							JO 
						Sure--but in his day, men 
						were men. Today, they're 
						too scared to be anything but 
						honest.
 
							ALICE 
						But a brave man can sure get 
						away with plenty.

125 	FULL SHOT
	Goes on looking over paper.
							MAIZIE 
						Say, you musta been readin' 
						the papers. Or maybe you 
						been drinking "crazy water" 
						and your head's Wrigley. Be 
						yourself, Alice, playing the 
						heavy heavy don't suit you.
 
							ALICE 
						It's getting me down--always
						broke--never a break.
 
							JO 
						Why don't you ditch that ham 
						and pick yourself a rich 
						husband?
 
							ALICE 
						Rich husband--I've heard 
						they do come that way--but 
						not often.
 
							MARVEL 
						Often enough--but not our 
						way.
 
							ALICE 
						The girl has brains. We don't 
						need to put a zipper on her 
						skull to prove it either.
  
	Jo smiles, but Maizie is 
	intent on an item in 
	Variety. Her eyes widen.
 
126 	She waves the paper and shouts.

							MAIZIE 
						Alice! Listen to this--Don 
						Maxwell, personality imper-
						sonator, gets lucky break.
 
							JO 
						Why, that's your husband, 
						ain't it?
 
127	Alice is very excited--
	runs over to look on.
 
							ALICE 
						Pipe down--let her read it, 
						will you?
 
							MAIZIE 
						"By queer quirk of fate, actor 
						falls heir to Australian estate. 
						This paper is trying to find 
						him. He used to be around in 
						vaudeville days, but we have 
						not heard much of him lately. 
						Well, more power to you, 
						Don. We thought some day 
						you'd impersonate the right 
						guy."
 
							MARVEL 
						The lucky ham--from now 
						on he'll have the company of 
						a good egg.
 
							JO 
						Will wonders ever cease? Our 
						little Alice in Wonderland--
 
							ALICE 
						I'm in wonderland, all right--
						wondering if that ham's 
						around. Say--I wonder if 
						he's still with that goofy 
						professor.
 
							(knock on door)
 
							MAIZIE 
						Scram for cover--who is it?
 
							MAN'S VOICE
						It's me-
 
	Maizie opens the door.
							MAIZIE 
						Aw, nothing but old music in 
						the ear. The chorus girl's 
						bunion producer.

	Young man enters.
 
							MARVEL 
						Well, what's news from the 
						front?
 
							YOUNG MAN
						Front, my eye--it's the firing 
						line.  Show's closed.

							MAIZIE 
						In the woids of Walter Win-

						of actors--those on the 
						screen, those on the radio
						and those on their ears"--
						well back to the fan dance for 
						Maizie.

							JO 
						Well, it may be the bread line
						for us--but Alice don't have
						to worry. She's struck it rich 
						--But I'm nothin but a nothin.

	To Alice.
							YOUNG MAN 
						About time--after all that 
						digging.
 
							ALICE 
						You bet, and I'm off to a fly-

						Now you can all come up and 
						see me some time--
  
127a	CU JO with bathsalts.
 
							JO 
						Say, when do I take these 
						bath salts--before or after 
						my bath?
 
128 	JONES' OFFICE--Jones 
	questions Mrs. Buckley. 
	Very easy manner.

							JONES 
						Your husband seems to be 
						harassed about something. 
						Are you aware of it?

	Much the dutiful 
	wife--put on 
	for Jones.
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						Oh, indeed. I am very anx-
						ious to have him cured. Dr. 
						Meirschultz has been hand-
						ling the case. 

Slow questioning.
							JONES
						So I understand. Has the 
						doctor treated him for--
  
	A little exasper-
	ated at Jones' 
	slowness. Very sweet.
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						Pressure on his brain. It can 
						be easily removed and all 
						James' worries will be over. 
						Oh, I will be so happy.
 
							JONES 
						Do you realize your husband 
						is in a dangerous condition? 
						Has Dr. Meirschultz tried any 
						new theories on him?
	Very explanatory 
	--her sweetest 
	manner.
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						Oh no. Not on my husband. 
						He has a theory about glands 
						as stimulants. Why, he has 
						brought dead animals back to
						life.  He has performed some
						amazing experiments.

	Fully for their effect.
							JONES 
						Mrs. Buckley, do you realize 
						that you are shielding a 
						murderer--?

	She is scared stiff. Wants 
	to shield Meirschultz but 
	wants to save herself 
	from any complicity.
							MRS. BUCKLEY
						Why--er--what do you 
						mean by that--why, Dr. 
						Meirschultz--
 
	Takes it when she says 
	"Dr. Meirschultz." He 
	watches carefully as he 
	says the following
							JONES
 						No, not Meirschultz. Your 
						husband had a dying woman 
						in his arms when found.
 
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						Oh, surely, the doctor can 
						explain that. My husband is 
						innocent. You ask the doctor. 

							JONES 
						Tell me exactly what hap-
						pened when your husband 
						left Dr. Meirschultz.

	She tells this 
	fable carefully careless.
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						He didn't want to sign the 
						necessary papers to enter a 
						hospital proper. The first 
						thing I knew he had the most 
						terrible spell he has ever 
						had. And before the doctor 
						could help him--there was so 
						much confusion I fainted. 
						When I came to he was gone.

	Very careful questioning.
							JONES 
						Then he did not take the 
						young lady with him?

	Trying to save 
	Buckley to get 
	him out.
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						He may have. I think I did
						see her then. You had bet-
						ter ask the doctor. He can 
						tell you exactly what she died 
						of--you'll find she wasn't 
						murdered--
  
	Ushers Mrs. 
	Buckley out.
 							JONES 
						I'm sure we can straighten 
						this out. You have been very 
						helpful. Thank you.
 
129							MAXWELL 
						I didn't have anything to do 
						with it. They could not 
						understand why he had not 
						been confined long ago. You 
						knew he was dangerous. So 
						did they.
 
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						You can't double-cross me 
						like that.  You were to help 
						me. You were to operate on 
						him. You were going to put 
						him under my power.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. 
						That was your idea!
 
							MRS.BUCKLEY 
						Say, what's made you so 
						cocky?
	Ushers her to door.
							MAXWELL 
						I have a plan--I would like 
						you to help me carry out. Be 
						here at eight tonight.
 
130	EXTERIOR Meirschultz.
	Alice comes up walk--looks 
	Mrs. Buckley over and swings 
	up to door. Jones is still 
	concealed.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Did you wish to see someone?
 
							ALICE 
						I understand my husband is--
						your assistant. May I see 
						him please?

	Stalling.
							MAXWELL 
						Ah--he isn't here now.

	Very dismayed.  
							ALICE 
						You mean he doesn't work 
						for you?
 
							MAXWELL 
						No, not exactly. Why the 
						great anxiety? It must be 
						something important.
 
							ALICE 
						It is--you know what a 
						struggle he's had.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Indeed, he has often told me.
 
131	Enlarging to make the doctor 
	feel her importance. Her 
	eyes grow large and Max 
	looks intently at her.
 
							ALICE 
						He's inherited a fortune.
 
							MAXWELL 
						You say a fortune. He never 
						spoke to me of any rich 
						relatives.
 
							ALICE 
						He hardly knew of them him-
						self.  I believe it was his 
						uncle in Australia.
 
							MAXWELL 
						I am certainly glad to hear it. 
						I know he'll be pleased.

							ALICE 
						Don't tell him. I want to be 
						the first to bring him the 
						news.
 
							MAXWELL 
						That's only natural. Maxwell 
						will be here around eight 
						tonight.
 
							ALICE 
						Okay--I'll be here at eight.
 
	She goes out door.
 
132 	Jones wanders casually in to 
	office. Max starts--nervous.
 
							JONES 
						How do you do.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Well, news of Buckley?
 
							JONES 
						Yeah, he was picked up--
						also the body from the 
						morgue. Say, what did you 
						have to do with stealing that 
						body?
 
							MAXWELL 
						Why, Buckley stole that body. 
						That's what alarmed Mrs. 
						Buckley so. I have been try-
						ing to get her to put Buckley 
						in an institution but she 
						wants to keep him.
  
							JONES 
						So--that's it. Buckley took 
						the body.
 
	Maxwell beams, thinking he 
	is safe with that story.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Yes indeed. He has been a 
						difficult case. Now that you 
						have him in custody--you 
						have him haven't you?
 
							JONES 
						Oh, yes, he's in good hands 
						now.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all 
						right when she gets used to 
						the idea.
 
							JONES 
						Do you have many patients, 
						doctor?
 
							MAXWELL 
						Oh no. Mostly research in 
						endocrinology.
 
							JONES 
						Mind if I look around? 
						Seems to me you have car-
						ried on some interesting
						experiments.
	Sure of himself 
	but taking no 
	chances.
     							MAXWELL 
						Sure, I'll take you thru.
  
133	OMIT                                                                              

134 	They walk thru.
 
135 	Advance to basement steps--
	door.
 
							JONES
						What's down there?
 
							MAXWELL 
						Oh, just the basement. Some 
						day I intend to build an
						experimental laboratory down 
						there. It will save me from 
						intrusion.
 
							JONES 
						I'd like to have a look.
 
136 	They go down--look around 
	but Jones sees nothing.

							JONES
						Where did you say your 
						assistant went?

	Max is nervous. Does not 
	know what to answer.
							MAXWELL 
						He? Oh, he's away for a 
						while. He'll be back, though.

137 	OFFICE.
							JONES 
						Thanks. I'll be seeing you.

138	To himself.
							[MAXWELL 
						Not if I can help it.]

139	Max is alone.
							MAXWELL 
						The gleam--it was in Meir-
						schultz' eyes when he wanted 
						to murder me. It was in 
						Mrs. Buckley's eyes when she 
						wanted to murder her hus-
						band. Alice had that gleam 
						in her eye when she wanted 
						to find me. She'd murder 
						me. That's what she wants 
						to do. I must get rid of her 
						--but how--Mrs. Buckley--
						she will help. She must 
						help--
	He picks up phone.
 						Mrs. Buckley, we are being 
						investigated. The police are 
						suspicious of you ... you 
						are withholding information. 
						... I think I have a way out. 
						Come over right away.
 
140 	Meirschultz lab.
	Mrs. Buckley has arrived. 
	She is very excited.
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						We must get him out or we 
						are lost.

	Maxwell watches her eyes 
	while she talks.
							MAXWELL 
						You are right. But before I 
						can get him back here, you 
						will have to help me.

							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						How? What can I do?

141  	Maxwell fixes hypo, filling 
	it from formula.  Looks at 
	formula, then at bottles.

							MAXWELL 
						[Something very important. I 
						have been threatened;] Mrs. 
						Maxwell, my assistant's wife, 
						is crazy.  She thinks I mur-
						dered her husband. [She 
						wants to murder me.] I want 
						you to help me quiet her--
						give her a shot from this 
						hypo. [Keep it hid till we get 
						her] down in the basement--
						there is a secret vault [there]. 
						We will put her there till we 
						get your husband--[then turn 
						her over to the authorities. 
						Then we will both be free.]
 
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						It sounds all right, except for 
						the fact that she's crazy. It 
						seems to me she has the 
						right idea--(laughs).
 
							MAXWELL 
						Oh, so you feel that way too 
						(he laughs). 
	Motions to other room. 
						Stay in there--I'll call you 
						when needed.

 	Mrs. Buckley goes in 
	to other room.
						(door opens)

142 	Alice enters. Maxwell comes 
	in and greets her. Motions 
	to chair.
 
	He lets down on his voice.
							MAXWELL 
						[Hello Alice.] I'm glad to see 
						you.
 
143 	Alice recognizes voice.
							ALICE 
						Gosh, you had me fooled.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Sh--sh--I want to have a 
						few words with you quietly.

144 	They go into laboratory.
 
							ALICE 
						So--friendly or otherwise--?
 
							MAXWELL 
						[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] 
						At last, I have really a secure 
						living for us. We can travel 
						or anything we choose.
 
							ALICE 
						Then you knew of the 
						inheritance?
 
							MAXWELL 
						Sure--I have one little job to 
						accomplish, then we can 
						leave together. No doubt you 
						are surprised at this disguise.
 
							ALICE 
						No, I wouldn't be surprised at 
						anything from you.
	Winningly.
							MAXWELL 
						Now, honey--you are here in 
						time to help me and you can--

							ALICE 
						I knew there was a catch in 
						this some place--but spill it.
 	Quiet and dramatic.
							MAXWELL 
						In the other room, I have a 
						crazy woman that I have 
						been treating.
 
							ALICE 
						Ha ha, you have been 
						treating.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Quiet, will you? This is ser-
						ious. Our lives are in danger.
 
							ALICE
						What do you mean "our"?

	He demands her attention.
							MAXWELL 
						That's what I said. Now, lis-
						ten to me. I want you to 
						help me take this woman 
						down stairs. I will give her a 
						shot. You can take care of 
						her till I get help.
 
							ALICE 
						How about me getting the 
						help. She's quiet now, isn't 
						she?
 
145 	He is fixing a shot for Alice 
	to give to Mrs. Buckley.
 
							MAXWELL 
						Yes, but she will break out 
						any minute. She is not 
						afraid of a woman. Just 
						push this into her arm. But
 						keep it hid, and all will be 
						well.
 
146 	Goes over to door and calls
 
 						All right, Mrs. Buckley. We 
						will go down stairs. I have a 
						special treatment room there.
 
147 	Maxwell stands back. Ushers 
	both women out in front of him. 
	He starts them down stairs.
 
	He backs out and shuts them in 
	the basement where the sealed 
	up body of Meirschultz is. 
							(door closes)
 
		 					MAXWELL
						(laughs maniacally)

	Stands with back 
	to door--hands 
	outstretched in back.
 
148 	Basement--both women are 
	scared stiff.
 
149 	Both eye each other fearfully. 
	Both think the other insane.
 
150 	Both conceal hypos. They 
	watch for a chance.
 
151  	Finally, tough Mrs. Buckley
     	makes lunge at Alice with hypo.
 
152 	Alice screams.
						(scream) 

153 	Mrs. Buckley takes it as sign 
	of insanity and ...
 
154 	Puts hand over Alice's mouth.
 
155 	Alice tries to free herself. 
	The fight is on.
 
156 	Meirschultz' office. Jones 
	comes in with officer.
 
 							MAXWELL
 						You here again?
 
							JONES
						Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you 
						treated him a little rough. 
						He's in the hospital. How 
						about it?
 
							MAXWELL 
						Oh, nothing. He is crazy, 
						that's all. I had a little 
						trouble with him.
 
							(muffled screams of woman)
 
							JONES
						What's that?
 
							MAXWELL 
						(laughs) Oh, nothing. A cou-
						ple of my patients having a 
						little argument.
 
						(more screams)
 
157 	Officer grabs Maxwell.

							JONES 
						Take me down there.

							MAXWELL 
						It won't do any good. They 
						are a pair of would-be mur-
						deresses fighting it out.
 
							JONES 
						Man, you're crazy. What 
						kind of a place is this?
 
							MAXWELL 
						Oh, I'm crazy, am I? Let me 
						tell you something.  Those 
						women have--the gleam--
 
							JONES
						Come on, we're wasting time.
 
158 	Jones drags Maxwell down 
	stairs as the screams subside 
	and all is quiet for a moment. 
	The officer accompanies them.
 
159 	The officer separates the 
	women and holds them.
 
160 	CUT to wall con-
	cealing cat and 
	Meirschultz. 
							(sound of cat meouwing.)

 
161 	CUT to Jones looking at wall.
							JONES
 						Say, what's behind that wall?

162 	CUT to Maxwell.
 							MAXWELL 
						Take that cat away. That's 
						Satan--the murderous Satan. 
						The wretch that ate Meirschultz' 
						heart. He still has the gleam--
  						even in that loathesome one 
						eye. It watches me--that gleam--
						that gleam--
 
163 	All look at Maxwell, horrified.
 
164 	CUT to Jones.

							JONES
						Quiet, doctor. What do you 
						mean by the "gleam"?
 
165							MAXWELL 
						The gleam--it haunts me. 
						Meirschultz had it. He knew 
						too much. He brought life 
						back to the dead. He had to 
						die.  Satan had it. Mrs. 
						Buckley has it. She wanted 
						to kill her husband. 
	He points to Alice.
						Alice wanted to kill me.
	Thrashes arms wildly.
						They all know too much--
						want to know too much.

166 	All but Jones are terror-
	stricken. He holds Max
	firmly.
 
							ALICE 
						Listen to that! I wanted to 
						kill him, did I? Well, I should 
						have done it--the lousy ham.
 
							(both women yell)
 
							(cat meouws again)
 
167 	During this time, Jones has 
	been edging nearer the wall 
	--motions to the officer to
 	handcuff Maxwell.
 
	Jones then tears down wall 
	and out jumps Satan and the 
	doctor's body is revealed 
	(or rolls out on the floor).
 
							MRS. BUCKLEY 
						It's the doctor! (turns to 
						Maxwell) Then, who is this?
 
168 	Jones indicates Max.
							JONES
						Mrs. Maxwell, isn't this your 
						husband?

							ALICE 
						I'm sorry to say--it is-- (or 
						"Yeah--what's left of him")

170	CUT to Maxwell raving 
	and gibbering. Officer 
	helps Jones.
 
							JONES 
						Come on, Maxwell--
 
171	CU Maxwell with faces and
	gleams darting thru his head, 
	especially Meirschultz' face.
 
							MAXWELL 
						The gleam--the gleam--they 
						drove me to it! I tell you, 
						they drove me to it! I didn't 
						want to use my art for mur-
						der or crime.
 
						They drove me--with hun-
						ger, with misery and humili-
						ation. I only wanted to 
						amuse--to entertain--but 
						here I am--spent my life 
						perfecting an art that no one 
						wanted--no one appreciated 
						--I was good--I was able--
						anyway, I showed them--Dr. 
						Meirschultz, a real imperso-
						nation (laughs maniacally). 
						Meirschultz--my supreme 
						impersonation.
