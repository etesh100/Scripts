INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



EXTREME CLOSE-UP - TELEVISION SCREEN



The National Anthem resounds over the precision maneuvers of 

the Navy’s Blue Angels. When Old Glory fills the frame the 

local announcer identifies the station, signifies the 

megahertz and signs off for the morning. Transmission ends 

and a BLAST of disturbing static rules the airwaves. It is 

2:30am on a Sunday morning.



CAMERA SLOWLY WITHDRAWS



The TV set appears. A fireplace is off to the right, trophies 

of outstanding achievement in annual home sales on the 

mantel; STEVEN FREELING asleep in his convertible chair, an 

open briefcase on his lap, real estate maps and lease 

contracts spread out on the floor by his stocking feet.



CAMERA CONTINUES TO WITHDRAW until we are moving out of the 

living room of this suburban two-story home and up the 

stairs.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT



CAMERA MOVES along the hallway, past the guest bath and over 

to a partially open door. We explore this room, if only for 

an instant, to catch DIANE FREELING, 32, tossing in her 

sleep, a tangle of hair covering her face.

INT. DANA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



CAMERA moves away and slithers into another bedroom. DIANA 

FREELING is sixteen, very beautiful, and snoring unevenly. 

She is surrounded by potato chips and homework.

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



The SOUND OF TELEVISION STATIC leaks as the CAMERA moves into 

the last bedroom. ROBBIE FREELING is just a seven-year-old 

lump under the covers. With the sheets tucked around him, he 

looks like a ghost and where his head should be there is a 

Dodgers baseball cap. The closet light is on and the closet 

opened only a crack to let in the safe night light as we pass 

beyond Robbie to CAROL ANNE FREELING. The STATIC SOUNDS from 

the O.S. TV seem to arouse this pert six-years-old from a 

sound and regular sleep. Her eyes snap open. She listens, 

flicks some sleep from her eyes, and rises out of bed.

CAMERA TRACKS AHEAD OF HER as if drawing her OUTSIDE the 

safety of her bedroom and roommate brother.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



The STATIC crackles louder and a BLUE GLOW dawns across Carol 

Anne. She could be sleepwalking. Her eyes are riveted and her 

breathing quickens. The STATIC BOOMS now and Carol Anne stops 

at the TV set in front of her sleeping dad. She stares into 

the white snow, trying to see beyond the color dots. Carol 

Anne opens her mouth until we are certain she is going to 

SCREAM. Then



CAROL ANNE



Hello! Hell-ooo! What do you want! 

Hello! Who are you! 

Hell-ooooo!

INT. DANA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



She is already swinging her legs out of bed and moving into

INT. LIVING ROOM - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT



The entire family gathers and watches their youngest child 

yelling through the static at 2:35 in the morning.

What do you look like! Hello! Can I 

see you?

EXT. CUESTA VERDE ESTATES OVERLOOK - DAY



Anyone outside of Manhattan is familiar with this setting. 

Sunday in suburbia. A neighbor mows his lawn, another washes 

his car, and a group of kids play soccer in the street. The 

middle America World War II bought and paid for.

EXT. FREELING FRONT YARD



Then; an irregular glitch to this setting. A man, JEFF SHAW, 

is running as furiously as his jelly-bowl paunch will allow. 

In his arms, a large brown shopping bag. Barely avoiding a 

collision with the paper boy, he cuts across the lawn, 

jiggling the lettering. He crashes into the front door, 

finding it locked. He turns and runs around back, just as 

Steve opens the front door.

INT. FREELING KITCHEN - DAY



Shaw blasts past Dana, dressed in a terrycloth robe. She is 

eating potato salad right out of the bowl in front of the 

refrigerator.



DANA



Jesus H. Christ!



12

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY



Shaw almost loses his footing turning into this room. His 

breath exploding in wheezing puffs. He falls into a chair 

next to Steve Freeling and FIVE OTHER MALE NEIGHBORS who tear 

into the brown shopping bag, surfacing with Michelob Lites.



SHAW



What’d I miss!?



STEVEN



Haden

 fumbled!



ARNIE

STEVEN



Shhhhhhhh

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - DAY



Diane is straightening things in here when she notices 

something that causes her to sadly catch her breath. She 

walks forward to the bird cage slowly letting it out. Carol 

Anne’s yellow canary is feet up on the bottom of the cage.



DIANE



Oh Tweety, couldn’t you wait for a 

school day?



14

14

EXT. FREELING’S BACK YARD - DAY



Robbie is next to a tall, misshapen oak tree that has grown 

bent forward, a little too close to the house. Robbie is 

marching in circles around the tree, acting brave. He starts 

to climb.



15

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY



The Sunday FOOTBALL CROWD is on its feet. Haden has the ball 

again and the pass is a “bomb”.



STEVEN



Look at that fuckin’ Dennard run.



SHAW



Lester Hayes. Fuckin’ Hayes is 

there!! He’s there! He’s...



The channel changes all by itself to Mister Rogers.



STEVEN



(yelling at the wall)



Tuthill--! You 

asshole!



ARNIE



Turn it back! Christ!



STEVEN



Sorry guys. When my neighbor uses 

his remote... he’s on my same 

frequency.



Steve turns it back to football. A second later, “Mr. 

Rodgers” is singing. Steve walks over to the wall, and points 

his remote control and fires!






5.

From the other side of the wall comes a muffled ROAR.. The 

voice of BEN TUTHILL.



TUTHILL (O.S.)



Don’t start, Freeling!



16

16

EXT. SLIDING DOOR/FREELING HOUSE - DAY



Steve opens the sliding glass door and yells over the fence. 

Tuthill, a robust man in a tank top and sunglasses, yells out 

his window, the remote control brandished in Steve’s 

direction.



STEVEN



We got a game going on over here!



TUTHILL



The kids 

wanna

 watch Mr. Rodgers!



STEVEN



I don’t care what you’re watching, 

as long as you show a little mercy 

with that thing!



TUTHILL



(closing his window hard)



Move your set!



STEVEN



Move yours!



Tuthill clicks at Steve through his window.

Steve’s channels change and the gathering SCREAMS again.

Steve fires his remote at the Tuthills and a muffled 

“

INT. HALLWAY TO BATHROOM - DAY



Diane has Tweety by his little claw feet at arms length. With 

a sour grimace she moves into the bathroom and raises the 

toilet seat, aims Tweety and... Carol Anne steps into the 

doorway catching her Mom red-handed.






6.

CAROL ANNE



Tweety--!!

Oh

EXT. FREELING’S BACK YARD - DAY



With his own bedroom window facing him, Robbie climbs among 

the twisted branches, then looks at the neighborhood and the 

sky beyond.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY



CLOSE SHOT - CIGAR BOX



Diane places little 

Tweety

 into the cigar box. She starts to 

close the lid.



CAROL ANNE



Tweety

 doesn’t like that smell.



DIANE



Sweetheart, Tweety can’t smell a 

thing.



CAROL ANNE



(giving orders)



Put a flower with him.



Diane smiles at this thought and takes a red rose from the 

vase on the windowsill. Carol Anne pulls into her pocket and 

takes out some red licorice. She bites off the end, spits it 

out into her hand and places the wet piece inside the cigar 

box.



CAROL ANNE



For when he’s hungry.



She places a Polaroid snapshot of herself and Robbie.



CAROL ANNE



For when he’s lonely.



She covers him with a napkin.






7.

CAROL ANNE



For when it’s nighttime.



Carol Anne starts to cry as she closes the lid. Diane looks 

on. She really loves this kid.



22

22

EXT. FREELING’S BACK YARD - DAY



Diane has dug a hole in the dirt. Robbie and Dana watch as 

Carol Anne places the cigar box into the earth. Dana is 

eating celery and Diane throws her a “you’re chewing too 

loud” look. Robbie, from up in the tree, watches fascinated 

as Diane and Carol Anne refill the hole. In the background 

the football game is winding up with loud interludes between 

the time-outs of the final quarter.



CAROL ANNE



Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray 

the Lord my soul to keep...



DANA



(rolls her eyes)



Brother...



DIANE



(to Dana)



Stifle it!



CAROL ANNE



If I should die before I wake...



DANA



(a defiant whisper)



It did.



CAROL ANNE



I pray the Lord my soul to take.



DIANE



That was lovely, honey.



ROBBIE



(staring at the freshly 

dug earth, calls down 

from the tree)



Mom, when it rots can we dig it up 

and see the bones?



DIANE



Robbie!!

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



CLOSE UP - GOLDFISH BOWL



Carol Anne stares wondrously as two brand new goldfish nibble 

Hertz Mountain from the surface. Robbie sits on his bed in 

his PJ's reading a 

Popeye

 comic. Distant THUNDER can be heard 

as Robbie looks over at his window.



ROBBIE’S POV



A weak flash of lightning outlines the tree he was playing in 

earlier. It is not merely the overactive imagination of a 

nine-year-old that makes this tree scary to us. The twisted 

branches that seem to suggest arms and the split trunk that 

appears to suggest horns is all too real even at first 

glance.



CLOSE - ROBBIE



He doesn’t want to look. He doesn’t want to scare himself. 

But he does.

DIANE ENTERS O.S.



DIANE (O.S.)



Honey, you’re overfeeding them.



CAROL ANNE



Tweety-two

 and 

Tweety-three

 wants 

seconds.



ROBBIE



Mom, there’s a big storm headed 

this way.



DIANE



You’ll be asleep by the time it 

gets here... if you hurry. Lights 

out!



The kids dive for the covers. Diane turns out the light. The 

room is overwhelmed by darkness. Carol Anne speaks up first.






9.

CAROL ANNE



(rapidly)



Closet light! Closet light!



DIANE



My fault. My fault.



Diane turns on the light in their closet and cracks open the 

door. Carol Anne relaxes and waves good-night to her fish. 

Robbie looks over at the rocking chair by the bureau. Sitting 

straight up is clown doll. It is almost the size of Robbie. 

Its stare is devilish and its smile is just a little too 

broad for comedy.



Robbie gets up and without looking at the doll, throws a 

plaid shirt over its head. He climbs back into bed, outlined 

by a blue flash from the window.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT



CLOSE ON DUTCH MASTER CIGAR BOX



Two hands lift it from the shadows and into the light. The 

lid starts to open and just as we expect to see Tweety-one we 

see the “stash” instead. Steve removes a lid of grass and 

some zigzag papers and starts to roll a joint. On the TV is 

an old MGM movie.



Diane is reading Carl Jung’s MAN AND HIS SYMBOLS. Steve picks 

up a brochure on pool equipment and diving boards.



DIANE



(taking a hit)



Sleepwalking. Sleepwalking. 

Nocturnal Somnambulism. * I’ll 

betcha it’s genetic. Carol Anne all 

last week and then last night. Me 

when I was ten. I once walked four 

blocks and fell asleep in the back 

seat of this man’s car. He went all 

the way to work before discovering 

me. God. I started screaming... 

people ran over. The police came. 

They took the guy downtown. My 

father had me examined for bruises, 

hickeys, I don’t know. Oh 

shit

, 

Steven! If we dig the pool and 

Carol Anne falls in before there’s 

any water... Steven... are you 

listening?






10.

Steven takes the joint back from Diane and pulls it down 

halfway in one breath -- holding the hit.



STEVEN



(he talks like Dennis 

Hopper)



Ever go off a three meter board?



DIANE



What’s three meters?



STEVEN



About ten feet.



DIANE



Honey, why don’t we just build the 

pool closer to the house and let 

the kids jump off the roof?



STEVEN



See, it’s like an air pocket. From 

three meters you’re free-falling. 

You can maybe squeeze in a half-

gainer, jackknife into a swan, 

twist back, tuck, splash.



DIANE



Splat!!



STEVEN



Spashhh.



DIANE



Splurg.



STEVEN



Honey, we can afford it.



DIANE



We don’t really need it.



STEVEN



It’s great for business. We build 

the first house. We install the 

first pool. Look around us. By 

summer



(in bass baritone)



“the hills are alive with the smell 

of chlorine”.



DIANE



Yeah and, our pool will be alive 

with a thousand guests.

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



Steven flops Robbie onto his pillow just as a flash lights 

the room and the tree outside the window. Carol Anne lies 

awake, watching.



ROBBIE



I don’t like the tree, Dad.



STEVEN



It’s an old tree. It was here for a 

long time. Long before my company 

built this neighborhood.



ROBBIE



I don’t like its arms. It knows I 

live here, doesn’t it?



STEVEN



(not aware this scares 

Robbie)



It knows everything about us. 

That’s why I built our home next to 

it. So it could protect you and 

Carol Anne, Dana, your mom and me. 

It’s a wise old tree.



ROBBIE



It looks at me. It knows I live 

here.



Robbie is visibly frightened now and Steven realizes he’s 

scared him. Just then a tremor of thunder rolls through the 

bedroom and Robbie snuggles up to his dad.



STEVEN



Storm’s gonna miss us.



ROBBIE



How do you know?



STEVEN



Because I can count.



Then more thunder. Robbie flinches, but tries to be brave.






12.

STEVEN



After you see the lightning, count 

until you hear the thunder. If you 

can count higher each time, that 

means the storm is moving away from 

you.



A flash of lightning is seen.



STEVEN



Now count with me.



ROBBIE/STEVEN/CAROL ANNE



One, two, three...



Thunder is HEARD.



STEVEN



Next time you’ll be able to count 

to four or more. You try it, okay?



ROBBIE



Okay.



Steven exits leaving the door open. Lightning occurs. Steven 

waits by the partially open door and listens as Robbie 

counts.



ROBBIE



(very worried)



One... two... three... four... 

five...



Distant thunder is HEARD. Robbie is more relieved.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DANA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



He feels real good about himself. He KNOCKS on Dana’s door. 

Music is HEARD. The door opens.



STEVEN



Goodnight, Dana.



DANA



Uh, 

goodnight

, Dad.

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



Robbie looks out the window. The tree stands there in the 

wind. Another flash of lightning, Robbie controls his fear 

and concentrates.



ROBBIE



One, two...



CRACK! BOOM! An explosive jolt of thunder rocks the house. 

The closet light goes out as the tree outside the window 

suddenly bends forward as if looking in. Robbie sits bolt 

upright. Carol Anne wakes up SCREAMING.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MUCH LATER - NIGHT



Carol Anne and Robbie are asleep next to Diane and Steve. The

SLOWLY MOVE IN CLOSER TO THE TELEVISION



The pre-recorded voice of the station manager signs off. A 

beat... Transmission ceases and the soft roar of dead air 

fills the room as the static white snow colors the walls, 

making shadows flicker and warp.



It is only now that we first hear it. A SOUND intermingling 

with the TV hiss, like a bad connection from far, far away. A 

whisper. Not one, but hundreds of them. They say nothing. 

It’s a chorus, tonal and inviting.

CLOSE - CAROL ANNE



She turns on her side. And her eyes open 

surreally.

 Ever so

child.

The snow mixes with new imagery. Forms. Vague but luminous. 

Always mingling. Impressionistic. Never hard-lined.



CAROL ANNE

Come out... come out...



The picture tube starts to SNAP! Little flashes momentarily 

blind Carol Anne. She blinks and tries to see deeper. SNAP! 

CRACK! It’s as if flashbulbs were being emitted. Steven and 

Diane turn fitfully but remain asleep. FLASH! POP! Robbie is 

close to waking.

Smiling, on her knees now... she reaches out toward the TV 

screen when... SOMETHING REACHES BACK. A Substance. A form, 

like a wispy, smoky tentacle twists forward, EXTENDING FROM 

THE PICTURE TUBE and snaking into the Freeling bedroom. 

Transparent and cold, it gives birth to itself, builds upon 

its own energy, growing brighter as it seems to hover above 

Carol Anne, then tower over the family asleep in the king-

sized bed.

CLOSE - CAROL ANNE



She must bend her neck to look all the way up at the ceiling 

where this cyclonic shape waltzes... studying.. at the room, 

then Carol Anne...



AN EXPLOSION from the TV set. The brightest flash yet 

experienced. A force that expels the intruder from the set 

and into the room. Catapulting it past the family and into 

the wall RIGHT OVER THE BED, where it leaves a dark pencil 

dot stain. The entire room shakes and the family is awake and 

panicked.



The window cracks, the curtain rod slips. Books and mementos 

fall from the open hutch. The medicine cabinet opens and 

prescription medicine splatters on the tiled floor. The room 

lights flare then die. Every picture topples from the walls.



28-F

28-F

Just as quickly as it began, the episode ceases. A HUSH 

descends. Everyone looks at Carol Anne. Carol Anne looks at 

everyone... then intones, almost matter-of-factly.



CAROL ANNE



They’re here.

The shovel of the bulldozer touches the earth and scrapes a

INT. KITCHEN - DAY



Steve is on the phone, nervously smoking a cigarette as the 

bulldozer can be seen out the window, digging the new pool. 

Diane is serving waffles around the breakfast table. E. Buzz 

sits at Robbie’s feet, watching the waffles hopefully. Only 

Carol Anne seems to have an appetite.



STEVEN



(on the phone)



I’m not kidding, Jeff. How could 

anyone sleep through a six-point-

five. Yes, damage. Stuff’s in 

pieces all over our bedroom.



DIANE



(quietly to Carol Anne)



Chew each bite ten times.



Carol Anne exaggerates her chewing; smiling with her mouth 

full.



STEVEN



I know that... we’ve had the radio 

on and there’s nothing about it.



(after a beat)



After the 

Sylmar

 quake it was two 

years before real estate was on the 

rise.

Diane is gently coaxing some information out of Carol Anne 

who mostly has her mouth full of waffles and blueberries.



DIANE



When you said, “They’re here” last 

night.



CAROL ANNE



Can I take my goldfish to school?



DANA



Maybe the fault line runs just 

under our house. Wouldn’t that be a 

scream?



ROBBIE



The ceiling got crumbs all over my 

bed.



DIANE



(to Carol Anne)



Sweetheart. Do you remember last 

night? Do you remember when you 

woke up and said, “They’re here?”



CAROL ANNE



Uh huh.



DIANE



Who did you mean? Who’s here?



CAROL ANNE



(mouth full)



The TV people.



ROBBIE



She’s stoned.



DANA



What do you know about it?



ROBBIE



More’n

 you. Ask Dad.



Robbie picks up his milk to take a sip when the bottom of the 

glass drops out, the milk splashing back onto Robbie’s cereal 

bowl, overflowing cereal all over the table and onto Dana’s 

blouse in a burst, perhaps slightly strong for the small 

amount of spilled milk.



DANA



Hey--!

ROBBIE



(throwing up his hands)



It’s not my mess.



DANA

Thanks a lot, jerko - I’ve got

ROBBIE



Mom.



DIANE



Gimme that thing before you cut 

yourself.



Carol Anne has a big dripping splash of milk running down her 

forehead. Oblivious to this she just keeps eating, goes over 

to the kitchen TV... turns it on to the “Today Show”, then 

switches to an “in between” channel and watches the snow.



STEVEN



I’m

DIANE



Breakfast first.



ROBBIE



(casually)



All right, I’ll just flunk.



Robbie shrugs, reaches for his spoon to resume eating and 

notices something unusual. The spoon is bent. He looks around 

the table. Every spoon is bent. Shrugging it off, Robbie 

lifts his cereal bowl and drinks right out of it, two tiny 

trails dripping off his chin, spotting his school shirt.

EXT. FREELING’S BACK YARD - DAY



A big man, 

PUGSLEY

, thirties, bald, steps out of his pool 

install action truck wearing combat boots, a Teamster T-

shirt, mirrored sunglasses and a baseball cap turned around 

backwards on his head. He motions to the bulldozer driver to 

“take a gander”. Dana grabs her bike and rides off. The 

workmen pause to stare at her. 

Pugsley

 and the dozer driver 

share a salacious grin and the dozer driver pops his clutch 

rapidly, the dozer lurching suggestively several times.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY



Diane has witnessed this sloppy display through the open back 

door. Choosing to pass over it, she turns toward the kitchen 

table to clean up. E. BUZZ, the dog, is sitting on a pulled-

out chair eating from everyone’s plates. Diane sighs and 

shoos E. Buzz away.



DIANE



When you leave the table, Carol 

Anne... Robbie, you push your 

chairs in.



Carol Anne is trying to fine-tune the snow on television.



DIANE



Aw, honey you’re going to ruin your 

eyes. This is not good for you.



She turns the set to another channel where a WAR MOVIE is 

showing. Soldiers blowing up and screaming.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY



Diane is cleaning up. Broken glass surrounds her. She cups 

her left hand and picks narrow shards out of the shag when 

the GROWLING begins. Diane turns and sees...



DIANE’S POV



E. BUZZ is growling at the wall. Looking up at something we 

don’t see. Diane sidesteps the broken vases to follow E. 

Buzz’s 

eyeline

 right up the wall and onto the stain.



CLOSE - DIANE



She cocks her head curiously.



MOVE IN - THE STAIN

It has grown since this morning. Like a Rorschach pattern. 

Diane tries to rub it out with a pillowcase. She slips into 

the bathroom and wets one corner, then returns when...



Diane stops. Carefully, she watches E. Buzz, who has ceased 

growling.



FULL SHOT - DIANE AND E. BUZZ



Never removing his spaniel eyes from the wall, E. Buzz’ tail 

starts wagging. He backs a scoot away from the wall and 

executes and obedient “roll-over”. Diane herself retreats.



DIANE



(gently)



C’mere, E. Buzz.



E. Buzz turns, but his mind is not on Diane. He runs out of 

the room between Diane’s legs immediately returning with his 

chew-ball. E. Buzz sidles up to the wall and sets his chew-

ball down, “speaks” and executes a double roll-over.

Pugsley

)



Okay, 

Bluto!

 

Gimme

 my cup.



PUGSLEY



Gee, Mrs. 

Freeling

 you make great 

coffee. Good for a second cup.



Pugsley breaks out laughing. Diane grabs the cup out of his 

hands and drops the blinds in his face.

Diane turns to find all the chairs are withdrawn from their 

intended places. She looks for Carol Anne then jumps halfway 

out of her skin.



Carol Anne is right behind her, tapping her on the side.



DIANE



Jesus, don’t do that. You 

wanna

 see 

your mommy lying in a cigar box 

covered in licorice?

Carol Anne shakes her head... slowly.



DIANE



(pointing to chairs)



Did you do that?



Carol Anne shakes her head slowly.



Diane replaces the chairs in their proper places and returns 

to the sink. She opens the cupboard under the sink, and 

brings out a bottle of 409. She stands and turns around...

FACING HER IS THE KITCHEN TABLE



The chairs are stacked one atop the other, reaching all the 

way up to the ceiling. Diane jams her fist into her mouth to 

press back the natural reaction. Carol Anne stands below her 

smiling up at the pyramid.



DIANE



(a whisper to Carol Anne)



The TV people?



CAROL ANNE

INT. KITCHEN/NEW, VACANT HOME - DAY



WIDE ANGLE - IDENTICAL KITCHEN



In a disconcerting jump, all of the furniture, Carol Anne and 

Diane disappear. The basic structure of the kitchen remains 

exactly the same for this is a model home somewhere in Cuesta 

Verde Estates.



Steve Freeling walks into the empty setting with a family of 

prospective buyers. Only the wallpaper is different from the 

Freeling residence.






21.

STEVEN



This, then, is our latest 

development. We call it phase four.



WOMAN BUYER



Where is your home, Mr. 

Freeling?



STEVEN



We were the first family to set up 

housekeeping in Cuesta Verde 

Estates.



HUSBAND



(helping)



Phase one!



STEVEN



That’s right. Actually you passed 

through my neighborhood to get 

here.



WOMAN BUYER



The area with that “lived in” look.



STEVEN



In a month you won’t be able to 

distinguish phase four from phase 

one from phase... well, around here 

grass grows greener on every side.



HUSBAND



Yeah... I can’t tell one house from 

the other.



STEVEN



Our construction standards are very 

liberal. Matter of fact, a neighbor 

of mine put a jacuzzi in his 

bedroom, with a running aqueduct 

connecting it to the wading pool 

outside which he built half in, 

half out of his living room. That 

home was featured in last month’s 

issue of Town and Country.

Sparse lightning over the mountains as the storm clouds begin

smell two hundred dinners in all of the ovens of Cuesta

Steve Freeling’s Oldsmobile station wagon turns down the

Three empty trashcans block the drive... Steve groans as he 

parks half on, half off the curb, climbs out, and starts 

removing obstacles when from nowhere Diane is there, 

literally pulling toward the house.



STEVEN



Hey babe. Guess who just bought L-J 

237...



DIANE



Just c’mere! Hurry!

INT. KITCHEN - DUSK



We have never seen Diane focused and again so frazzled. Her 

words are coming in spurts. She must constantly catch her 

breath. The thrill in her voice is backed up against an 

oppressive fear.



DIANE



Okay, okay... look. Okay. Listen. 

I’ve kept Dana and Robbie out of 

this, but Carol Anne was with me 

when it started so I cut her in, 

but Dana would blab and 

Robbie’d

 be 

up for three weeks sleeping on your 

side of the bed.






23.

STEVEN



Diane, put the breaks on will ya. 

Just sit down a sec.



DIANE



No, goddammit, you sit down! I 

mean... stand right there. And 

just... just have an open mind. 

Reach back into our past when I 

used to know you with one and use 

it for the next 

coupla

 minutes.



Carol Anne suddenly appears from around the corner looking 

exhausted and cranky. In her hand is a San Diego Charger 

football helmet.



CAROL ANNE



Mommy didn’t cook any dinner.



DIANE



(loud)



We’ll go to Pizza Hut, all right?



ANGLE - STEVE



Looking around he sees chalk marks all over the kitchen 

floor. Arrows and squares and numbers in two colors.



Diane’s breathing quickens as she steadies herself. Skipping 

to the kitchen table she takes one of the colonial country 

chairs from the breakfast table and scrapes it along the 

floor to the center of the room where four circles have been 

described in chalk. Diane places each leg in one of the 

proscribed circles and looks up at Steve.



DIANE



(last words)



Okay... okay now, watch!! Watch!!



She removes her hands from the back of the chair and steps 

aside. Steve watches Diane as much as the chair. He starts to 

step forward when Diane throws both of her hands out to stop 

him.



DIANE



Look!



The chair begins to tremble. It virtually jitterbugs in 

place... then begins to move forward picking up speed until 

it traverses the entire length of the kitchen ending up right 

in front of Steve’s bullfrog eyes.



ANGLE - CAROL ANNE

Yawning.

With hysterical victory in her eyes.



CLOSE - STEVE



Looking for wires. He kneels and feels the chair legs, then 

immediately looks to Diane for the answer.



DIANE



It’s okay. It’s okay. Look!



(to Carol Anne)



Sweetheart, show Daddy.



CAROL ANNE



(angry now)



I’m hungry.



DIANE



Don’t argue!!



Carol Anne shrugs and puts on the football helmet. Diane runs 

over to Steve’s side and pushes the chair out of the way. 

Carol Anne sits on the floor in a circle with her name on it 

in yellow chalk.



ANGLE - STEVE



Starts to run for her protectively. Diane restrains him.



LOW ANGLE - CAROL ANNE



She starts to tremble as if on a funhouse ride. Her little 

body begins to move forward, faster, and all the way across 

the kitchen floor right into Diane’s arms.



CAROL ANNE



(rubbing her fanny)



That burned!



DIANE



Sorry, baby, floor needed more wax.



STEVEN



What the 

fuck

!!



DIANE



You try!



STEVEN



What???






25.

DIANE



You can’t believe the feeling.



STEVEN



What’s the gag? There a magnet back 

there?



He looks behind the door in the dining room. Nothing. Steve 

just stands for a long moment in hapless silence, then...



STEVEN



I hate Pizza Hut! Where’s supper? I 

don’t understand, Diane. What the 

hell’s going on around here?



Steve sidesteps the chalk marks, removing himself from the 

active area.



DIANE



I figured I’d never explain it to 

you. So I showed you instead, but 

don’t ask me how or what. Just help 

me figure out what to do.



STEVEN



You mean there’s no gimmick?



DIANE



Not from inside the house. Maybe 

Tuthill got himself a super remote 

from the Radio Shack.



Carol Anne adjusts her helmet and sits inside her launch 

circle. Diane and Steve are having the discussion across the 

room and aren’t aware of her.



STEVEN



Maybe the shake-up and this 

thing... relate.



DIANE



No shit.



CAROL ANNE



Daddy, look at me!!



They turn but it’s too late. Carol Anne shoots across the 

room faster than before, and with no one to catch her.



ANGLE - KITCHEN WALL



At a sickening speed her helmet smashes into the wall. Diane 

SCREAMS. Steve runs over. 




26.

(MORE)

An eight-inch hole in the wall and the cracked plastic on the 

helmet testify to the force of impact. Carol Anne is dazed 

but unhurt.



CAROL ANNE



You promised pizza.

EXT. BEN TUTHILL’S FRONT PORCH - LIGHT



The front door opens and Tuthill steps into the bug light. An 

obvious strain in this conversation.



The motives various, the feelings mutual. About a thousand 

mosquitos chow down on the 

Freelings

 while they talk.



STEVEN



Hi, Ben.



DIANE



Mr. Tuthill.



TUTHILL



TV’s off in here. If your set’s 

acting up again...



STEVEN



(laughing nervously)



No, no, 

uh-uh.

 Nothing like that. 

We were wondering... although this 

is going to sound strange coming 

from me.



TUTHILL



I doubt it.



STEVEN



(swatting the mosquitos)



These mosquitos... Jesus.



TUTHILL



(so nonchalantly)



They never bothered me. I never 

been bitten by one. 




27.

TUTHILL(cont'd)

Far as I know, no member of my 

family’s effected by ‘em.



(grabs his fourteen-years-

old kid)



Mosquito ever suck on you, son?



KID



Heck, I don’t know, Dad.



Meanwhile Diane and Steve are being massacred.



TUTHILL



He don’t know.



Suddenly, there is a crash from somewhere inside the Tuthill 

home. Tuthill glances causally over his shoulder, turns back 

to Diane and removes a wet piece of cigar tobacco from the 

tip of his tongue.



DIANE



Mr. Tuthill, what my husband was 

wondering...



STEVEN



(breaking in)



Yes. You see, Ben, something funny 

in our house... next door. 

Something...



DIANE



You been having any disturbances 

lately?



TUTHILL



(suspiciously)



What sort of disturbances?



DIANE



(trying to be casual)



Oh, dishes or furniture moving -- 

around by themselves?

INT. FREELING MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT



Diane is applying calamine lotion to Steve’s neck and wrists.



DIANE



I had to say something. I was 

losing a pint of blood every few 

seconds.

STEVEN



I think we should keep this thing 

in the family. In the morning I’ll 

call someone in.



DIANE



Who for instance? I’ve already 

looked in the yellow pages. 

Furniture movers we got. Strange 

Phenomenon... there’s no listing.



STEVEN



Okay. I have a plan. I have a plan. 

Something’s occurring here that we 

can’t explain. If Carol Anne wasn’t 

wearing that helmet...



DIANE



Okay, stop it.



STEVEN



What if she wasn’t? Jesus, Diane. 

We’d be at County Emergency and not 

getting ready for bed.



DIANE



Okay already!



STEVEN



Right. Okay. Let’s wake the kids. 

No big deal! Let’s wake them, spend 

tonight at the Travel Lodge in 

Broxton.

 And come back tomorrow 

with experts! Experts who can tell 

us what it is that’s happening and 

if it’s safe to go home.



DIANE



Now you’re scaring me. Don’t try 

and scare me, Steve.

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



Robbie is wide awake. He is staring out the window from under 

the covers. There is a flash of lightning. Robbie begins 

nervously counting.



ROBBIE



One... two... three... four... 

five...






29.

The SOUND of rolling thunder. Robbie tenses and watches the 

tree.



ANGLE - WINDOW



A wind rustles the gnarled branches. The sky is a rolling 

mass of gray and black.



A second flash of lightning and Robbie whispers to himself.



ROBBIE



One... two... three...



CRACKLE! RUMBLE! The window pane vibrates as the shock wave 

from the thunder bears down and the wind begins to dance with 

the tree.



INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT



DIANE



(getting her back up)



I’m the one who lived with this 

freaky thing all day. And nothing 

bad happened. It’s like another 

side of nature. A side you and I 

are not qualified to comprehend. 

When you overreact like this it 

makes what happened much too 

important.



STEVEN



Nobody goes into the kitchen until 

we know what’s happening.



DIANE

box)



We’re out of papers.

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



Robbie is watching the tree. Carol Anne is asleep but she’s 

tossing and moaning like the wind outside the window.



Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING. Robbie pulls the covers up over 

his nose and mouth. His little breath pushing the fabric up 

and down as he counts.



ROBBIE



One... two...






30.

KA-BOOM! The room vibrates and Robbie takes his eyes off the 

window for just a moment, looking at the open bedroom door 

and the light down the hall from his parent’s room. He could 

be out of bed and there in six seconds if he hurried.



A SAVAGE CRACK OF LIGHTNING. THE EXPLOSION OF THUNDER RIGHT 

ON TOP OF IT.



Robbie snaps a look at the window just in time to see it 

happen.



46-A

46-A

ROBBIE’S POV



A hurricane BLAST of wind hits the monster oak. The two 

branches resembling arms fold forward aiming at the window. 

The disfigured crown with the horns and knotty eyes bends 

back before tipping forward.



The finger-twigs at the end of the arms reach out hungrily.



46-B

46-B

ANGLE - THE WINDOW



THE ENTIRE TREE CRASHES THROUGH ROBBIE’S WINDOW.



A FURNACE OF LIGHTNING accents the assault. Robbie starts 

SCREAMING. The finger-twigs wrap around him like skeleton 

hands and lift him right out of bed.



Carol Anne sits up and SCREAMS for Diane.



The tree seems to be exhaling. Its breath enveloping Robbie 

in a phantom haze. The arms begin to retract pulling Robbie 

toward the mouth and eyes.



46-C

46-C

ANGLE - ON THE DOOR



Just then, Steve and Diane appear in the doorway. Diane 

SCREAMS as...



The tree pulls Robbie right out the window and into an eighty-

mile-per-hour night. The ROAR of wind is almost unbearable... 

drowning Robbie’s SCREAMS and  those of his parents and Dana 

who suddenly appears in the doorway.



46-D

INT. DOWNSTAIRS



Carol Anne is suddenly forgotten as Dana, Diane and Steve 

hurl themselves downstairs and through the kitchen, only to 

find the door blocked by several large branches. 




31.

They scramble back through the kitchen, out the sliding glass 

door and into the raging storm.

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - ANGLE - CAROL ANNE



The force from the shattered window shoves Carol Anne against 

the headboard of her bed where she hugs her clown doll with 

all her might, its broad smile suddenly disconcerting as it 

appears to be looking toward the closet in her room.



46-F

46-F

ANGLE - THE CLOSET



The closet door opens revealing the most feared and dreaded 

space in this five-year-old’s tiny, tiny world. Carol Anne 

looks where her doll is looking and SCREAMS horribly.



47

EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - SECOND STORY WINDOW - NIGHT



The storm lashes the tree. The tree lashes Robbie. RAIN and 

WIND and CONDENSATION make it difficult to see everything.



Sixty branches form a briar prison that starts to tear and 

strangle. Steve races outside. A WALL of WIND makes his run 

SLOW MOTION.

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM



ANGLE - THE CLOSET



The light inside grows to a supernatural intensity and a 

SOUND unlike anything anyone would ever want to hear blasts 

through the velocity of the storm. It is the closet sucking 

the bedroom into its murderous glare. Anything not tied down 

is swallowed. Carol Anne grabs her covers, and SCREAMS. NO 

SOUND comes out.



She is lifted completely off the bed by the suction. Only her 

death-grip on the sheets keeps her away. Unbelievably, her 

clown doll is not affected by the vacuum pull. It just sits 

on the floor where Carol Anne dropped it and stares up at 

her, smiling.



49

EXT. SECOND STORY WINDOW - NIGHT



ANGLE - TREE



Steve reaches the twisting trunk and starts to climb. Diane’s 

SCREAMING from the patio is lost in the storm.






32.

Steve reaches Robbie and the fight is defined only by the 

flare of stroboscopic lightning. Every time it appears as 

though Robbie will be freed, branches envelop him and wind 

him tighter.



50

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



CLOSE - CAROL ANNE’S TINY HANDS



The sheets start to peel back. The closet swallows toys and 

posters of Darth 

Vader

 and 

R2D2

, then sucks harder, the NOISE 

something like a colossal straw pulling at the last drop from 

a deep, deep well. Only now does the bed give way, flipping 

into the air and flying across the room, slamming Carol Anne 

inside and blocking the opening with its frame and springs.



EXT. SECOND STORY WINDOW - NIGHT



ANGLE - TREE



Steve tears at the branches, trying to free Robbie. A crimson 

fluid pumps thick from the branches that Steve destroys. As 

suddenly as it began, the final burst of wind passes the tree 

like the caboose at the end of a runaway train. He frees his 

son and they topple out of the tree. Robbie throws his arms 

around his Dad and the two hold on for their lives, gasping, 

hugging, choking on the rain and sap. The tree is uprooted 

before them and disappears into the storm.

EXT. FREELING’S BACK YARD - NIGHT



Steve and Robbie lie on the ground. Both are numb and 

buzzing. Diane runs over and hugs them. Then Dana looks in 

the sky and points to the horizon.



DANA



Look, Mom... Dad!!!



Diane and Steve look off into the sky miles away.

EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT



A funnel cloud is moving away from Cuesta Verde Estates,

Upstairs?

Everyone runs to the house.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL TO CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



Steve and Diane are first into the room. Their expressions 

say it all.

57

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



FULL SHOT



With the exception of the two beds blocking the closet, 

Robbie and Carol Anne’s room is stripped clean. Diane lets 

out a muffled shriek and throws herself against the 

barricade, pulling back mattresses, 

boxsprings

 and blankets.



Steve joins her and together they work side by side, panting, 

crying and calling for Carol Anne.



ANGLE - ROBBIE



Still in a state of complete dislocation, Robbie walks back 

into his bedroom and looks at the window. The tree is there 

no longer. E. Buzz, the dog, joins Robbie, whimpering at his 

feet.



ANGLE - THE CLOSET






34.

Over Diane, SCREAMING out Carol Anne’s name, Steve does the 

muscle work, pulling off end tables, Lone Ranger lamps, chest 

of drawers, toys and stuffed animals, working his way to the 

bottom of this innocent debris.



CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE IN. Going beyond Steve to his hands at 

work as he lifts the last layer of mayhem off Carol Anne’s 

favorite pink blanket.



There is a folded lump beneath it. The lump doesn’t stir. 

Diane covers her mouth and hyperventilates as Steve gently 

removes the fuzzy blanket and...



IT IS THE CLOWN DOLL, SMILING UP AT THEM OUTRAGEOUSLY.



STEVEN



She’s not here!



DIANE



(turning and calling)



Carol Anne!



Dana goes to the shattered window and calls out.



DANA



I’ll check the kitchen!



STEVEN



Don’t go in there! I’ll check it. 

You look in your room.



DIANE



I’ll go!! Look in the bathrooms!



CLOSE - ROBBIE



Robbie’s expression never changes as everyone pushes past him 

on the run. He slowly walks to the closet and looks in.



ROBBIE’S POV



The clown.

Steve swings into the room. The television set is on but the 

local transmitter must be out. There is only static snow.

No answer.

Diane passes the TV. Snow, but no transmission. She checks 

the bed, the closet, the bathroom, becoming more frantic with 

every dashed hope.



DIANE



Oh Jesus Christ Almighty. Carol 

Anne!

This is crazy. I’ve looked 

everywhere.



DIANE



(suddenly realizing)



Oh my God. The swimming pool!



Everyone breaks running. Again passing Robbie in the hall. 

Robbie turns into his mother’s room. The SOUND OF TV STATIC 

and blue video glow growing stronger with every step.

EXT. BACK YARD POOL EXCAVATION - NIGHT



Dana, Steve and Diane race to the edge. The rain has softened 

the edges and Dana’s feet slide out from under her. She 

starts to fall when Diane grabs her wrist, Dana simply 

dangles above the deep end, filled with two feet of rainwater 

and mud. Steve slides down the steep muddy shoot from three 

to nine feet and plunges his hands into the quagmire.



He finds nothing.

CLOSE ON ROBBIE



The blue TV light flattens Robbie’s features, accentuating 

his lingering catatonia. 




36.

The TV HISS is growing steadily and Robbie starts to register 

something. From the back of his eyes, awareness regains 

awareness that shifts to terror. Robbie opens his little 

mouth and produces a low MOAN that slides relentlessly to the 

upper registers of primal release.



ROBBIE



MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

 

MOMMY

EXT. POOL EXCAVATION - NIGHT

Robbie is stationed not six inches from the nineteen-inch 

screen, hysterical, holding his hair in his fists. Diane 

grabs him up and locks her eyes to his.



DIANE



What is it?! Oh my Christ, what is 

it?!!!



The STATIC HISS is almost unbearable. Through it all we can 

still make out “the voice”.



VOICE



Mommy...



Diane frantically searches the room.



DIANE



Carol Anne! Where are you?!



Diane puts Robbie down and runs in a wide circle looking. The 

HISS is everywhere. E. Buzz growls at the TV.



VOICE



Mommy...



Diane is hysterical now. The first time we’ve seen her lose 

control.

Walking to the TV screen again.



ROBBIE



Mommy. Here! Here!!



Diane turns to look. She freezes, and only the rivulets of 

perspiration move across her. Diane doesn’t even breathe.



TV SET - SLOW PUSH IN



Carol Anne’s voice is heard again, buried deeply behind the 

horizontal blurring, the electron bombardment, the swirls of 

snow and noise.

Three banks of cold fluorescent purr down from the ceiling.



CAMERA PANS DOWN, past rows of metal bookshelves from which 

reams of notes, files and textbooks hang in no organized 

manner. Finally, the view STOPS on DR. MARTHA LESH, Professor 

of Psychology at the University of California at Irvine. 

Wearing a purple afghan to hide the urge for jelly beans and 

souffles, Norm looks up from her questionnaire and takes off 

her reading glasses. She is sixty-one and full of pep. Next 

to her are two long-haired graduate students, TAK and RYAN.



DR. LESH



Who are the members of the

ages?

Diane, my wife, she’s 31.

Dr. Lesh writes five years old on the form.



DR. LESH



Has there been any publicity about

STEVEN (O.S.)



Absolutely no. 

Uh

 

uh.



DR. LESH



Can you be reasonably sure of not 

letting any get started?



STEVEN (O.S.)



It’s the last thing in the world we 

want.



DR. LESH



Would your family welcome a serious 

investigation of the disturbances, 

by someone who could make first-

hand observations?



ANGLE - STEVE FREELING



His eyes are dark shadows and the unflattering light features 

the patches of stubble and parched lips. He speaks in hoarse 

whispers, viewing these surroundings with great suspicion.



STEVEN



Dr. Lesh. We don’t care about the 

disturbances... the pounding... the 

flashes or the music. We want you 

to find our little girl.



FADE OUT.

INT. FREELING HOME - STAIRWAY - UPPER HALLWAY - DAY



Dr. Les is mounting the stairs, followed by her two 

associates, TAK and RYAN. Steve is in the lead while Robbie 

keeps his distance in the rear.



STEVEN



I should warn you we’ve had to lock 

off the room from the rest of the 

house. Robbie sleeps with us now. 

Dana, our oldest, spends a lot o 

time with... with friends.



DR. LESH



How many disturbances have you 

recorded in this room?



STEVEN



We don’t go in there any more.



RYAN



We’ll record any 

psychotronic

 

energy or event.



DR. LESH



Ryan filmed an extraordinary 

episode during a case in Redlands.



RYAN



A child’s toy, small matchbox 

vehicle, rolled seven feet across a 

linoleum surface. The duration of 

the event was seven hours.



STEVEN



Seven hours for what?



RYAN



For the vehicle to complete the 

distance. This would never register 

on the naked eye, but I have the 

event on the time-lapse camera.

HER POV - INSIDE THE ROOM



Inside is a junk pile of shattered furniture and toys. The 

window is boarded up. Objects are in motion throughout the 

room... the bed is hopping about, records are flying, a lamp 

sails through. The clown is seated upside down on the 

boxspring

 as it spins. Children’s picture books flapping 

their covers like wings, cruise the upper reaches. A horse 

flies by. Finally, a spinning compass plays a record while 

flying toward the roar of the room, creating an eerie melody.

All semblance of clinical cool is gone. They are blown away.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY



Diane’s VOICE is heard over two shaking hands trying not to 

spill a pot of coffee as it fills a cup.



DIANE’S VOICE



None of us have been much fun to be 

around. I guess you can tell I 

haven’t slept very much. Steve’s 

stayed home from work so much. He’s 

been really wonderful. Really.



PAN UP from the shaking hands to Dr. Martha Lesh. She must 

now use both hands, steady the coffee she’s just poured. Her 

assistants are in no better condition.



ANGLE - DIANE



She looks terrific. Her eyes are alert, hair combed back and 

held with a bright yellow clip. She sips her coffee with rock 

steady hands and softly inquires.



DIANE



How long have you been 

investigating haunted houses?



DR. LESH



(embarrassed, 

backtracking)



Well, Mrs.

(MORE)

DR. LESH



The determination as to whether 

your home is haunted is not a very 

easy one.



At that moment the coffee pot moves by itself to the table’s 

edge but doesn’t spill. Dr. Lesh tries to overlook this, for 

appearances sake.



DR. LESH



What I meant to say was this could 

very well be a poltergeist 

intrusion instead of the classic 

haunting.



STEVEN



There’s a difference?



Two bright flashes of light distract Lesh and her associates.



RYAN



Anybody see that?



DIANE



There’ll be two more in a few 

seconds. They always travel in 

pairs.



Tak sits holding the camera with his mouth hung open. Lesh 

nudges him.



DR. LESH



Dr. Casey!



Tak snaps out of it and looks down to adjust the lens setting 

just as two more flashes go off in the air.



DIANE



Gotta

 be quicker than that around 

here.



RYAN



It’s electrical... you can smell 

the charge.



DIANE



You were saying poltergeists...



DR. LESH

DR. LESH(cont'd)

In the general vernacular, 

hauntings seems to be connected 

with an area... a house usually.



TAK



Poltergeist disturbances are of 

fairly short duration. Perhaps a 

couple of months. 

Hauntings

 can go 

on for years.



Diane takes Steve’s hand, suddenly frightened.



DIANE



Are you telling me all this could 

just end at any time?



DR. LESH



Unless it’s a haunting. But as a 

rule, there seems to be no living 

person around whom haunting 

incidents revolve.



DIANE



Then we don’t have much time, Dr. 

Lesh. Because my daughter is alive 

somewhere in this house.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK



THE FAMILY AND THE INVESTIGATORS



Everyone is assembled around the console TV. Ryan has a 

Nakamichi cassette recorder on the coffee table and a pencil 

microphone taped to the television speaker. Tak has erected 

his Nikon on a small aluminum tripod aimed at the screen, 

plus two infrared heat seeking cameras and monitors which 

scan the entire living room. An electrostatic locator to 

measure ionization and a magnometer that measures magnetic 

changes. Diane is holding Steve’s hand.



Dana comes into the room with an overnight bag strapped 

around her shoulders.



DIANE



Dana, I’d like you to meet 

doctor...



DANA



(clipped)



It’s getting dark, Mom. I gotta go. 

I’ll call you from 

Trudie’s.






43.

STEVEN



She won’t stay in the house after 

dusk.



ROBBIE



(disgusted)



She’s got brains!



Diane flips on the set. A local news station is finishing the 

report when Diane turns to channel 27.



DIANE



We receive better on this channel 

but don’t ask me why.



Dr. Lesh is thoroughly perplexed. She puts on her glasses as 

Steve turns out the lamp and lights a cigarette. Diane 

squeezes her husband’s hand. The CAMERA PUSHES IN to the TV 

screen and millions of particles of white air.



Diane turns the volume up and Ryan, wearing headsets, 

flinches, adjusting down the volume on his recorder.



DIANE



I’ll call her.



She says this so matter-of-factly that Dr. Lesh gasps. Diane 

walks to the center of the living room, folds her hands in 

front of her, collecting her thoughts, takes a very deep 

breath and calls to the ceiling.



DIANE



It’s mommy, sweetheart. We want to 

talk to you. Baby, please answer. 

Please talk to me, Carol Anne.



Dr. Lesh looks quickly to Tak and Ryan for their human 

responses to this. Tak shrugs unnoticed. Ryan adjusts in his 

chair and looks up at the ceiling.



E. Buzz prances into the room, looking up as if following on 

the heels of someone with a treat.



DR. LESH



(to Tak breathlessly)



Look at the dog.



He sits up on his hind legs and begs to no one we see.



DIANE



Are you with us now? Can you say 

hello to Daddy? Say hello to Daddy, 

baby.






44.

CLOSE - RYAN



He tries hard not to smile. No matter. The suppressed laugh 

is slapped away by what he now hears. Ryan grabs his headsets 

in two hands, pressing them hard to his ears.



TAK



(tight whisper)



Good Lord...



Everyone turns away from Diane and back to the TV. They 

strain their hearing, leaning forward, watching...



VOICE



(softly, sweetly, far 

away)



Hello, Daddy.





*** PAGE MISSING ***





DIANE



Carol Anne. Where is this light?



DR. LESH



Tell her to stay away from it!



STEVEN



Tell her, Diane!!



DIANE



Sweetheart, the light is dangerous. 

Don’t go near it. Don’t look at the 

light.



Tak speaks into Dr. Lesh’s ear.



TAK



I can’t believe it. It’s just a 

Zenith. But the voice could be 

C.B.

 

broadcasting from somewhere in the 

house. I’m taking a look.



DR. LESH



It’s not a hoax.



TAK



We’ll see.



Tak takes off.






45.

E. Buzz barks into the air twice and catches something in his 

mouth. No sooner does Dr. Lesh catch this out of the corner 

of her eye when several midair electrical discharges 

illuminate the room.



STEVEN



What’s that?!

INT. THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR - DUSK



From one of the flashes a number of tiny objects fall to the 

carpeting. Jewelry, cameos, broaches, coins, watches, both 

modern and pocket, along with many thin, wiry clips, sprinkle 

the floor.

E. Buzz immediately starts to sniff whatever it is.

Anything?



RYAN

Nothing’s registering.

DIANE

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - TAK - DUSK



He goes room to room looking for pranksters. When he gets to 

the active bedroom he hesitates, listens through the door, 

pulls in his courage and turns the knob. Of course, the door 

is locked. Tak is never without a trick. He slips a file from 

his utility belt and starts to jimmy the door. The lock gives 

and Tak easily turns the knob, and lets out an agonizing 

SCREAM! He falls backward holding his side, rolling over and 

over until he is at the top of the carpeted staircase.

Come to life and start registering wildly.



Diane can’t stand the screams. She holds her ears, in tears 

now, imploring Dr. Lesh with her eyes.



DIANE



Carol Anne! Oh God!!



Steve holds Diane to him, she pushes away and SCREAMS at the 

ceiling.



DIANE



You 

fucking

 bastard, she’s just a 

baby!



VOICE



Mommy! Mommy!



DIANE



(screaming through tears 

to Dr. Lesh)



Help her! Can’t you hear what’s 

happening?!






47.

We HEAR soft FOOTSTEPS running across the ceiling and down 

the wall. Two lamps are turned over and smash to pieces on 

the library table.



We next HEAR colossal FOOTFALLS BOOMING in pursuit. A gust of 

interior wind races through Diane’s clothes and hair. She 

SCREAMS in combined joy and horror.



DIANE



She just moved through me. My God, 

I felt her. I can smell her! She 

went through my soul!!



Diane runs back to Steve and grabs his shirt, pulling him to 

her.



DIANE



Smell my clothes. It’s her. It’s 

her all over me.



Steve smells and can’t believe it.



STEVEN



It is her!!



The footsteps in pursuit grow louder. Diane turns to face the 

sound. Dr. Lesh turns. Steve and Ryan turn. A perfectly foul 

smell precedes an implosion of displaced air. Almost the 

sound of thunder, the impact is so great. Lesh, Diane and 

Steve blow backward, their clothes flapping in the gale as 

the force passes through each one of them and out the picture 

window that cracks in a dozen places but does not shatter.



DR. LESH



(picking herself up)



Have you ever heard of the term 

“

teleportation

”?



DIANE



Carol Anne!



ROBBIE



That’s like when Mr. 

Spock

 beams up 

Captain Kirk on “Star Trek”.



DR. LESH



Just about. In a recent case, 

objects which disappeared from a 

house would be seen much later 

falling to the ground outside.



DIANE



Carol Anne doesn’t answer. Steve?






48.

DR. LESH



(to Steve)



Where exactly do you suppose Carol 

Anne was playing before she 

vanished from sight?



DIANE



Her bedroom closet. And she wasn’t 

playing.



DR. LESH



Let’s go up there.



STEVEN



It won’t let you in.



DR. LESH



We’ll just see about that.



Lesh practically rolls up her sleeves and heads for the 

stairway, the rest following.



INT. BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE - DUSK



As they come around the corner they run smack into Tak, just 

coming down the last step, rubbing his side.



DR. LESH



What happened to you?



TAK



I was just about to check out the 

locked bedroom when... I don’t 

know... something took a bite out 

of me.



Robbie gets very scared.



ROBBIE



You got bit?



TAK



That or the worst muscle spasm in 

the world.



DR. LESH



Roll up your shirt. Let’s have a 

look.



Tak turns to face the hall light and 

untucks

 his shirt, 

rolling it up. Then rolling up his T-shirt. Everyone crowds 

in to see.






49.

ANGLE - TAK’S STOMACH AND SIDE



Teeth marks bear out Tak’s story. The unusual thing is, the 

bite wraps all the way around his side from kidneys to navel. 

A pink and partially bruised eleven-inch crescent impression.



CLOSE - ROBBIE



Eye level with it, his little mouth hanging open.



ROBBIE



Wow!



Dr. Lesh takes a tentative step up the stairs then turns back 

demonstratively.



DR. LESH



Let’s everybody spend the night 

down here.



STEVEN



Honey, I want you and Robbie to

I’m not leaving Carol Anne.

I don’t want to stay here anymore. 

This place’s got jaws.

Dr. Lesh has returned to the living room. She bends over and

Blankets, pillows, sheets. Let’s

Robbie and Diane are curled up together in the convertible

HALLWAY - RYAN



Ryan sits in a chair facing the staircase and the upper level 

of rooms



His spectroscopic camera equipment is aiming directly up the 

stairs. Lesh pats Ryan on the shoulders, he nearly jumps out 

of his skin. They speak in whispers so as not to disturb the 

others.



RYAN



Jesus, my heart.



DR. LESH



(whispering)



Shhh. More thrills than grading 

papers, wouldn’t you say?



RYAN



(whispering)



I can leave any time, you know. 

This isn’t the Army and you’re not 

my mother.



DR. LESH



(whispering)



If push comes to shove, I bet I’ll 

beat you to the door.



(indicating monitors)



Any movement out of those things?



RYAN



(whispering)



There’s been some ionization 

fluct.

 

I’d like to make sure they’re not 

caused by humidity coming from 

structure leakage, but I’m not 

going up there to find out.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



Lesh goes to the console TV and, assuming everyone is asleep, 

she turns it off. In a very small voice Diane leans on her 

elbow.



DIANE



Please. Leave it on.



Dr. Lesh smiles, it’s the first time we’ve seen her do this 

and it reminds Diane at once of her favorite story-book 

grandma who bakes cookies and knits comforters.



CLOSE - DIANE



She smiles back and motions for Dr. Lesh to come over.



DIANE



When things get quiet like now I 

can imagine how all this must look 

from you end. I’m really 

embarrassed.



DR. LESH



Oh, nonsense. I’ll tell you what is 

embarrassing. My being here with 

you nice people. Parapsychology 

isn’t something you master in. 

There are no certificates of 

graduation, no license to practice. 

I’m a professional psychologist who 

spends most of her time engaged in 

this ghostly hobby, which makes me, 

I suppose, the most irresponsible 

sixty-one-year old woman I know.



DIANE



You were so funny. Your hands were 

shaking a mile a minute.



Diane starts to giggle. It’s a release and Dr. Lesh joins 

her.



DR. LESH



It isn’t over. I’m perfectly 

terrified. It’s all these things we 

don’t understand. I feel like the 

protohuman, stepping of the forest 

primeval and seeing the moon for 

the first time. Throwing rocks at 

it.






52.

(MORE)

DIANE



You mean someday we’ll understand 

these things?



DR. LESH



When it’s recognized for what it 

is. As any science. Understanding 

and sponsorship seem always to be 

one hundred years behind ridicule 

and doubt. Out of this experience, 

should we capture a high resolution 

photograph of a genuine 

manifestation Time Magazine will 

still put President Reagan on its 

next cover.



ROBBIE



If I got killed would I come back 

as a ghost and get stuck in the 

house like my sister?



DIANE



Your sister isn’t dead, Robbie.



ROBBIE



If I got killed could I visit her 

and show her how to get back here 

if you tied a rope around me and 

held it tight? Then somebody could 

come get me and we could move 

somewhere else?



DR. LESH



Some people believe that when you 

die your soul goes to heaven.



ROBBIE



When 

Grampa

 was dead I looked at 

him on the hospital bed and I was 

watchin’

, but nothing went out of 

him.



DIANE



His soul was invisible. You 

couldn’t see it going to the sky.



ROBBIE



How come Grandpa isn’t on 

television with Carol Anne?



DR. LESH



Some people believe that when you 

die there is a wonderful light. 




53.

DR. LESH(cont'd)

As bright as the sun but it doesn’t 

hurt to look into it. All the 

answers to all the questions you 

want to know are inside that light. 

And when you walk into it... you 

become a part of it forever. Now, 

some people die, but they don’t 

know they’re gone.



ROBBIE



They think they’re still alive?



DR. LESH



That’s right. Maybe they didn’t 

want to die. Maybe they weren’t 

ready. Maybe they hadn’t begun to 

live yet or lived a long, long time 

anyway, but wanted more life. They 

resist going into the light no 

matter how hard the light wants 

them. They hang around, watch TV, 

watch their friends grow up, 

feeling all unhappy or jealous and 

those feelings are bad, they hurt. 

And then some people just get lost 

on the way to the light. They need 

someone to lead them there.



ROBBIE



So some people get angry and throw 

things around like in my bedroom.



DR. LESH



Yes. Just like in school. There are 

people who are nice to you. And 

people who are mean.



ROBBIE



I got beat up once by three kids. 

They took my lunch money. Maybe 

they got hit by a truck and are 

upstairs right now.



DIANE



Let’s get some shuteye,

stomach growls. He turns back looking over his shoulder at 

the kitchen.

He leans his chair back on its hind legs until his head 

reaches around the corner. Tak “pfffts” to Ryan. Ryan looks 

up from a Penthouse Magazine that he is studying by penlight. 

Tak gestures for Ryan to relieve him for a few minutes.

The refrigerator is the perfect target for Tak’s

shoulder before opening the 

Amana

... the light inside bathes 

everything in white. Tak takes out a salad bowl and noshes 

from that, but his chewing is too loud so he opts for a 

beautiful New York steak wrapped in cellophane.



Placing the steak on the dark counter, Tak stuffs a chicken 

leg into his mouth and searches the kitchen for a steak 

knife. He pulls his flashlight from his hip pocket and beings 

pulling drawers...



A new sound is added to his search. A CRAWLING GUSHY SOUND 

that bubbles and softly hisses. Tak turns and sees a shape 

moving along the counter where he put the steak. Approaching, 

Tak tilts his flashlight so the beam hits the object moving 

on the counter.

His reflection is a ROTTING CORPSE, hair wild and streaming, 

his mouth open in a crazy way, teeth hanging by leathery 

threads, a funeral suit from the neck down.



The bulb over the mirror CHANGES HUE from white to yellow to 

orange to pink. In a burst of electricity it EXPLODES over

flashlight up into Tak’s face.

The fingers are almost to the bottom. The smoking fingertips 

suddenly rise straight up into the air like sky-writhing. 

Rising right up to the ceiling. Another tentacle of ectoplasm 

seems to come forward. Larger and thicker than the rest and 

still growing, it studies the VTR and 

Panasonic

waltzing above it, hovering curiously close, then retracting 

suddenly like a King Cobra.

THEIR POV OF VIDEO MONITORS - NIGHT



We SEE the empty hallway and staircase in black and white on 

one screen. One the other a spectroscopic breakdown of color 

patterns in infrared.



The picture on the screen becomes grainy, smoky. A bright 

glowly

 substance begins to form into tendrils that move down 

the stairs and very close to the cameras. The black and white 

monitor shows what the human eye captured. The color infrared 

shows what the technology captured.

The smoky substance twists and melts and forms what appears 

to be the shape of a man’s back. The shape moves in front of 

the CAMERA and we see what could be an OLD MAN looking over 

his shoulder with a suspicious expression, and then walking 

past a little girl, not Carol Anne, holding a ball. She 

wanders through the living room as if lost. Suddenly, the 

living room is filled with manifestations. FOUR MEN in burlap 

type coats, floppy hats, denim and boots face away from the 

CAMERAS, a WOMAN dressed in the style of the 

1920’s

 moves 

through the room, tears on her face -- people of all ages and 

descriptions wander aimlessly, lost and sad through the 

living room.



No manifestation makes contact with any other. They don’t 

even seem to be aware that others exist -- an OLD WOMAN 

glances at the CAMERAS disinterestedly -- and a YOUNG BOY 

moves toward the CAMERA and evaporates.



The screen suddenly becomes BLACK, filled by two glowing 

beams -- the beam pull back and we realize they are EYES of a 

scary old man. It is the face of pure chaotic horror. A 

vision of madness and murder.

I took it upon myself to...

Jesus, Steve, you look like shut. 

Aren’t you feeling any better.



Steve just stands there like a schoolboy caught playing

TEAGUE’S POV



Teague can see past Steve and into the living room and 

staircase. All sorts of scientific equipment is strung 

around. The big console TV is tuned to a static channel, so 

is the kitchen portable, also visible from Mr. Teague’s 

vantage.



Teague looks over Steve’s shoulder and Steve tries to subtly 

block his view.



MR. TEAGUE



Looks like your cable is out there.



STEVEN



Cable? Yes, the cable. Yes. We’ve 

had no TV for several days.



MR. TEAGUE



Well, we should look into that. Is 

the entire block dark?

STEVEN



Uh

Steve immediately steps outside with Mr. Teague and closes 

the door behind him. The porch light comes on and even in the 

bright daylight it glows to amazing intensity.



MR. TEAGUE



I see you have some electrical 

problems as well. What’s screwed in 

there, a three hundred watt bulb? 

You afraid of prowlers or trying to 

attract every insect in Cuesta 

Verde?



(he laughs)



STEVEN



My wife’s not feeling well either. 

She got a little of my bug.



MR. TEAGUE



Tell me something, are you happy 

here? I hope you don’t resent my 

leaping out to ask these things. We 

wouldn’t want to lose our best 

rep

 

to either the flu or... other 

“opportunities”. All that software 

set up in your living room made me 

wonder whether you’ve got a little 

something going on the side.



STEVEN



Just hobbies. Popular Mechanics.

Diane hangs desperately onto any tangible reality. She moves 

carefully through the house, cleaning up. When she passes

Diane slips her hand down to the doorknob. Knowing it is 

always locked she feels safe in trying it -- the knob turns 

in her hand. Tak never locked up after his episode. Diane 

GASPS and jumps back. As much as she wants to, Diane won’t go 

in. She backs into her own bedroom and shuts the door.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY



She turns and sees the bed is not made. Diane pulls off the 

covers and the sheets, making them ready for the washing 

machine. Dust rises off the bed and Diane SNEEZES. As she 

tilts her head back for a second sneeze she freezes looking 

at the wall over her head. The sneeze never materializes.



ANGLE - THE WALL



The STAIN HAS GROWN. It is three feet in diameter and shaped 

like a black rose. Little black, wiggly lines, like veins, 

scribble away from the black pistil in all directions. Diane 

flinches and steps away from it. She sees a picture on her 

other wall and determines to hang it over the stain.

Steve and Teague stand on a hill overlooking the entire 

Cuesta Verde Estates. Teague’s Bronco sits off to one side.



STEVEN



I’ve been up here once or twice. 

Diane calls it Vanity Point.



MR. TEAGUE



So who’s to say an artist shouldn’t 

step back from his easel to admire 

the sum of his parts?

When they build our model home, 

there was nothing down there. Just 

freshly turned earth and a lotta 

wooden stakes and miles and miles

MR. TEAGUE



One of your children was born in

I understand she’s missed a lot of 

school lately. 

Trask’s

 daughter’s

the flu as well?



STEVEN



Yeah, we’ve all got the same thing.



MR. TEAGUE



I’m sorry. I didn’t see her.



STEVEN



Oh, she’s around.



MR. TEAGUE

STEVEN



(his mind in the valley, 

snaps out of it)

Are you thinking of leaving Cuesta 

Verde?



STEVEN

I can’t believe how a day can be so 

beautiful. You wonder how anyone 

can have a problem in the world on 

a day like this.



MR. TEAGUE



(kicking up some sod with 

his heel)



Nice spot for a bay window, 

wouldn’t you agree?






67.

STEVEN



If you’re living up here, great. 

Wouldn’t be so terrific from the 

valley, looking up at a 

lotta

 

houses cutting into these hills.



MR. TEAGUE



You don’t have to live in the 

valley any more.



STEVEN



What are you getting at?



MR. TEAGUE



Phase Five is going up right where 

we’re standing. This could be your 

master bedroom suite. That could be 

your view. You interested?



STEVEN



Mr. Teague, that’s a very generous 

offer but I’m not a developer.



MR. TEAGUE



You’re responsible for 42% of 

sales, almost half of what we’re 

looking at down there. Almost 

seventy million dollars of 

dwellings and property. Maybe a 

generation of security that no one 

can put a price tag on. We should 

have made you a full partner three 

years ago... I don’t want to lose 

you now.



Steve doesn’t know what to think. So much is piling up so 

suddenly. It’s a golden opportunity that two weeks ago would 

have meant a Hawaiian vacation and days of happiness and 

celebration. Steve turns around to take in the view.

recent headstones.



Steve scratches and gestures to the three-acre memorial park.



STEVEN



Not much room for a pool.

MR. TEAGUE



We own the land. We’ve already made 

arrangements to relocate the 

cemetery.



STEVEN



Can you do that? I mean, isn’t it 

rather... I don’t know... 

sacrilegious?



MR. TEAGUE



Don’t worry about it. It’s not an 

ancient tribal burial ground. It’s 

just... people. Besides, we’ve done 

it before.



STEVEN



When?



MR. TEAGUE



In ‘76. Right down there.



STEVEN

Cuesta Verde?



MR. TEAGUE



All three hundred acres. It was 

quite a job, let me tell you.



STEVEN



(to himself, his mind 

racing)



I never heard anything about it.



MR. TEAGUE



Well, it’s not something you go 

around advertising on billboards 

and the sides of buses.



Steve is speechless. He looks back and forth between the 

existing cemetery and Cuesta Verde Estates below.



MR. TEAGUE



What are you worried about? 

Relatives and friends can visit 

their loved ones at 

Broxton

 

Memorial Park. It’s only five 

minutes further out for Christ’s 

sake.

STEVEN



(quietly, to himself)



Five minutes. I guess that’s no 

great hardship. I suppose that 

would be okay.



MR. TEAGUE



Okay with whom?



STEVEN



Whomever might complain.

They are sitting in an empty lecture hall. Monitors are

Apparently she’s been through quite an ordeal. Anthony Farrow 

is twenty years old than Dr. Lesh, which puts him into his 

early eighties.



He puts a comforting arm around her and sits on the desk, 

smiling like the wizened sage he is.



FARROW



In a word?



He hands her back the video tapes.



DR. LESH



In a word.



FARROW



Too graphic!



DR. LESH



It was the episode as it occurred.



FARROW



Perhaps.






70.

DR. LESH



Oh, Tony... you too?



FARROW



I so wish to accept what I saw. I’m 

only steps away from the old wooden 

bridge myself. To believe that 

something exists on the other side 

would be like a warm light in the 

window.



DR. LESH



Perhaps if tendrils of ectoplasm 

were all that showed up?



FARROW



Better.



DR. LESH



A smoky shape lasting merely an 

instant.



FARROW



Even better.



DR. LESH



Nothing on tape at all... only 

sounds, 

rappings

, a sigh.



FARROW



You’d still be answering questions. 

They’d all want to go back to the 

house tonight. You gave them too 

much, Martha. Too much too soon. 

Nothing was left to the 

imagination. This isn’t a science 

yet. It’s still a sideshow and your 

troubadours were not in their make-

up.



DR. LESH



And these? What do you make of 

these?



She gestures to the dozens of jewelry pieces on the desk. 

Farrow picks up a beautiful brooch. He holds it up to the 

light.



FARROW



It’s the real McCoy, that’s one 

thing for certain.






71.

Farrow pins the brooch on Lesh’s sweater and takes an antique 

ring, placing it on her finger.



FARROW



Dear Martha. May we cross that 

bridge together someday? May all we 

believe be true. May we picnic in 

the clouds.



Dr. Lesh starts to laugh and punches Farrow on his leg.



DR. LESH



You old con artist. If only you 

were fifty years younger.



FARROW



Let me give you some advice. Secret 

a few of those gems. Come out of 

this with something in your pocket. 

The National Enquirer pays more for 

inventing what we must bust our 

rumps investigating and for what?



DR. LESH



Okay, pops! I’m making you the 

accessory in this crime.



She picks out a set of earrings and stuffs them into her 

change purse. Farrow laughs as Dr. Lesh starts to fold up the 

napkin containing the stones and jewelry. Suddenly Farrow 

stops her, reaching for something in the pile.



FARROW



This is interesting.



He picks up a thin, wiry clip that looks like it could be a 

dog muzzle for a miniature poodle.



FARROW



Did this 

teleport

 with everything 

else?



DR. LESH



Yes, I picked it up myself. Why?



He turns it over in his hand.



FARROW



It’s a staple, a clamp for the jaw.



DR. LESH



Not something you’d wear to the 

masquerade ball.






72.

FARROW



No, but you would wear it to your 

own funeral. It’s a mortician’s 

trick. It prevents the mouth from 

suddenly dropping open when the 

body is in repose. It discourages a 

great deal of embarrassment and... 

fainting.



DR. LESH



(with a shiver she looks 

at her watch)



Oh darn, I promised I’d be back 

before dark.



FARROW



Martha, my dear. Why don’t you let 

Tangina

 have a go?



DR. LESH



(sourly)



I was afraid you’d suggest that. 

Tangina’s

 so... melodramatic.



FARROW



Yes. But she’s a house-cleaner and 

right now with what you tell me 

about that little girl, I think 

it’s high time you brought out your 

big guns.

EXT. CUESTA VERDE ESTATES, PHASE ONE - NIGHT



This time we are framing the first row of headstones, PUSHING 

PAST them to the warm suburban glow that reaches for miles 

into the hills, joined by a sprinkling of stars on this 

moonlit night.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



MOVING SHOT



We are following Steve and Diane. They seem to be gazing down 

as they walk through their home. CAMERA WIDENS to reveal Ryan 

and Lesh ahead of the Freelings. They appear to be following 

something, also looking down at their feet. CAMERA PANS DOWN, 

expecting to find E. Buzz at the head of this train. 

Instead...



We meet TANGINA BARRONS, astrologist, clairvoyant, midget.






73.

She is dressed in a California Hawaiian print dress, wears 

her hair in a beehive, dons aviator sunglasses and casually 

sips coffee from a mug as she explores the Freeling home.



Tangina stops and looks at her followers. She speaks with a 

very polite Southern accent.



TANGINA



Would you all mind 

hangin’

 back. 

You’re jamming my frequencies.



They oblige and Tangina waddles her way down the hall and up 

the stairs unaccompanied.



DR. LESH



I know what you’re thinking. You’ll 

have to take my word on this. She’s 

cleaned many houses. Her gifts are 

well documented at the 

parapsychology laboratory at Duke 

University, University of Virginia, 

the...



Diane is becoming more and more distraught over something.



DIANE



We haven’t heard a word from Carol 

Anne since last night.



TANGINA (O.S.)



Why is this door locked, Mr. 

Freeling?



Steve looks up the stairs, he’s about to answer but instead 

decides to concentrate. A pause.



DIANE



Answer her.



STEVEN



(softly)



I am.



Tangina appears at the upper rail and looks down between the 

banister posts.



TANGINA



I am addressing the living?



STEVEN



(giving up)



I’m sorry. That’s the room my son 

and daughter occupy.






74.

DR. LESH



We believe it’s the heart of the 

house.



TANGINA



This house has many hearts.



Tangina turns away and continues her search.



ANGLE - LIVING ROOM



Steve turns to Diane and Lesh and Ryan, pulling them into a 

circle of whispers.



STEVEN



(whispering)



I was trying to answer with my 

mind. She couldn’t hear me. I 

thought you said Tangina 

Barrons

 

was an extraordinary clairvoyant.



From far away and well out of earshot Tangina answers.



TANGINA (O.S.)



(upstairs)



I am. I just don’t like trick 

answers.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



The CAMERAS are all set up. The Zenith console is now the 

centerpiece of this room. The rest of the furniture has been 

piled against the walls although we’re not sure if this is 

Diane’s work or early poltergeist disturbances. Tangina sees 

herself on the video monitor and smiles into the CAMERA. She 

waves and watches herself waving on the monitor. She makes a 

funny face and gets a huge thrill at seeing it in black and 

white. Diane and Steve stand divorced from this. They have 

become bit players as Tangina takes center stage.



TANGINA



Can you make my face look bigger?



Thinking this is a scientific request, Ryan ZOOMS IN filling 

the monitors with Tangina.



TANGINA



Look at me for 

cryin’

 out loud! 

You’d never suspect I was just a 

teeny little thing, would ya?






75.

DR. LESH



Tangina, could we get on with this, 

please?



Tangina pulls out a lipstick and freshens her makeup, all the 

while watching herself in the monitor.



TANGINA



I’ve never been on TV before.



She steps back and looks into the CAMERA. She adds to her 

already thick Texas accent. The melodrama gushes out of her.



TANGINA



Yes, it was me all the time, not 

that fussy harlot from the office. 

I shot J.R. Ewing! I blew his 

little pecker right into the gulf 

of Mexico. I...



(embarrassed)



Oh, I swore on television.



No one is laughing. Especially Diane and Steve. They are 

rather appalled. Tangina immediately pulls back. She becomes 

an adult again and walks into the center of the room.



TANGINA



(to Diane)



Honey, c’mere and give me your 

hand.



Diane hesitates and looks over at Dr. Lesh.



TANGINA



I’m not gonna bite’cha.



Diane slowly walks to Tangina and reaches down with her hand.



TANGINA



C’mon down here. You’re gonna give 

me whiplash lookin’ up at you.



Diane smiles and kneels. She is eye level with Tangina.



TANGINA



(softly, just for Diane to 

hear)



Your daughter is alive and in this 

house.



The tears come immediately. Diane breaks down, sobbing, the 

first confirmation of her own belief from the outside.






76.

(MORE)

Tangina hugs her, patting the back of Diane’s head 

reassuringly. Steve starts to come over to comfort but 

Tangina waves him off and mouths...



TANGINA



... a glass of water.



ANGLE - DR. LESH



She sits down and smiles. Relieved, looks to Ryan. Ryan is 

filming it.



TANGINA



(to Dr. Lesh)



Where was the last incident of 

“

biolocation

”?



Dr. Lesh points to the air just above Tangina’s head.



TANGINA



I have my strongest feeling, the 

point of origin is inside the 

child’s closet. Upstairs.



DIANE



(through tears)



Yes. I feel that too.



TANGINA



(to Diane)



Now, honey. Are you 

gonna

 be real 

strong for me? For your daughter? I 

can do absolutely nothing without 

your faith in this world and your 

love for the children.



DIANE



I will. Believe me, I will.



TANGINA



Will you do anything I say? Even if 

it comes contrary to your beliefs 

as a human 

bein’

 and as a 

Christian?



DIANE



Oh yes. Please.



TANGINA



(cupping Diane’s face and 

bringing their eyes 

together)






77.

TANGINA(cont'd)

Then let’s get on our feet and go 

get your daughter.



Diane laugh-cries and rises. Tangina starts to rise but then 

realizes...



TANGINA



(brightly)



Oh... I am standin’.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER - NIGHT



CLOSE - TELEVISION CONSOLE



Static snow grates again on our nerves.



ANGLE - FULL



Diane is in her self-appointed position, the center of the 

room awaiting notice from Tangina Barrons who checks through 

a lot of items laid out on a tablecloth on the living room 

floor.



TANGINA



(

checklisting

)



Towels, red ribbon, 

handkerchiefs... 

How’re

 the tennis 

balls coming?



Ryan and Dr. Lesh are painting numbers on each of six tennis 

balls and then carefully signing their names. String hangs 

across the ceiling and to each wall coming together in the 

air six feet above the floor to form a square.



Steve runs in with several pounds of rope slung around his 

shoulder.



STEVEN



It’s all I could find.



TANGINA



It’ll do. How’s the bath water 

doin’?



STEVEN



I shut it off. It’s ready.



TANGINA



Then I don’t see any reason why we 

shouldn’t get started.



(to Diane)



All right, honey. Call out to her.






78.

In the low light of the living room, Diane stands in the 

center like a frightened contestant about to audition a song. 

She says a prayer under her breath and looks skyward.



DIANE



Carol Anne... Carol Anne... It’s 

Mommy. Can you hear me tonight?



TV CONSOLE - STATIC



Nothing.



DIANE



Carol Anne. Can you tell Mommy 

hello?



TV CONSOLE - STATIC



Nothing.



CLOSE - TANGINA



Her eyes are closed and her breathing becomes irregular. She 

licks at her dry lips and motions to Diane.



TANGINA



Try again.



DIANE



Can you say hello to Daddy? Daddy 

and I miss you so much. So much. We 

love you so much. Can you say 

hello?



CLOSE - TANGINA



Shaking her head.



TANGINA



She’s under restraint!



This news hits like a shock wave. Steve and Diane almost 

answer at one.



STEVEN AND DIANE



(overlapping)



She’s what?! What do you mean?! 

Who’s restraining her?!



TANGINA



Quickly. Who is she more afraid of? 

You or your husband?






79.

DIANE



She’s afraid of neither.



TANGINA



Which one of you does she answer to 

first?



STEVEN



She’s always gone to Diane.



TANGINA



When she’s naughty, whom does she 

hide from?



STEVEN



She’s a well-behaved child. We’ve 

raised her with manners and...



TANGINA



(losing her patience)



Look folks, I’m not the child abuse 

squad. I need a quick answer.



DIANE



Steve decides the punishment. The 

children have always known that.



STEVEN



(protesting)



Now wait a minute, Diane. I don’t 

call that fair. I’ve never laid a 

hand...



Tangina still has her eyes closed. She motions Steve to come 

over.



TANGINA



Fight about it later, meantime get 

your ass over here.



Steve obeys. Diane is lost. Dr. Lesh has never experienced 

anything like this before. Ryan has his eye to the video tape 

camera.



TANGINA



Tell Carol Anne to answer!



Steve is uncomfortable in speaking to thin air. He clears his 

voice.



TANGINA



Tell her!






80.

STEVEN



(very politely)



Honey, it’s Daddy. Can you hear 

me... Sweetpea?



TANGINA



Cut the 

crap

 and call her. Loud.



STEVEN



(a little louder)



Carol Anne. It’s Daddy.



TANGINA



Again.



STEVEN



(a little louder)



It’s Daddy, sweetheart.



TANGINA



Be cross with her.



STEVEN



Why...?



TANGINA



Be angry with her or you’ll never 

see her again!



STEVEN



(quickly, more aroused, 

harsh)



Carol Anne, this is your father 

speaking.



TANGINA



Tell her if she doesn’t answer 

she’s in big trouble.



STEVEN



Answer me right now or you’re in 

real hot water!



TANGINA



Tell her she’ll get spanked.



STEVEN



(aside to Tangina)



We never spank the children.



DIANE



(intervening)



Goddamnit

, Steven, tell her!






81.

STEVEN



If you don’t answer your parents 

you’re going to get a real 

spanking. From both of us.



TANGINA



Swear. Swear.



STEVEN

Damnit!

 

Damnit!

 You hear me?!



CAROL ANNE’S VOICE



(far away from the TV 

speaker)



Mommy, help me!



TANGINA



(really breathing hard, 

sweating)



She’s away from him!



DIANE



Away from who... that thing we saw? 

Is she all right?



TANGINA



(huffing like she’s 

running)



Diane. Is there a light?



DIANE



Carol Anne, do you see the light?



CAROL ANNE’S VOICE



He’s chasing me, Mommy...



(screams)



TANGINA



Tell her to run to the light.



DIANE



(looking at Dr. Lesh)



No!



TANGINA



They will follow her to it. They 

have been following her for weeks. 

You must tell her what I say

!





DR. LESH



Tell her. Go ahead, Diane.

DIANE



Run for the lights. Run as fast as 

you can!



CAROL ANNE’S VOICE



Mommy!! Are you in the light?



DIANE



No, honey, I’m...



TANGINA



Tell her you are

!!



DIANE



It’s a lie

!!



TANGINA



You can’t choose between life and 

death when we’re dealing with what 

is in between. 

Tell her before it’s 

too late

!



DIANE



Run to the light, Carol Anne, Mommy 

is in the light

!



TANGINA



Tell her you’re waiting for her.



Diane is now crying out of angry frustration and deceit.



DIANE



Mommy is in the light waiting for 

you

!



(she wheels on Tangina)



I hate you for this

Quick, upstairs everyone! Bring 

everything.

INT. STAIRCASE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT



Dr. Lesh, Ryan, Steven and Diane. Tangina

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM DOOR - NIGHT



Everybody crowds around. Tangina turns to Steve, her 

breathing coarse with phlegm and wheezing.






83.

TANGINA



Open it.



This time Steve doesn’t hesitate. He has the key already in 

the lock and swings open the door.



113

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



It is like a storm at sea inside. So much destroyed minutia 

speeds through the air it is not unlike a blizzard at night. 

The SOUND is a CHORUS of MOANING; and RAVING.



A VOCAL ASYLUM FROM A BLACK PLACE WHERE ALL SOULS WAIT FOR 

TRANSIT.



A CACOPHONY OF MUSIC REVERBERATES THROUGHOUT. Nothing 

specific, only madness and nonsense.



INTO THIS WALL OF NOISE AND TORMENT TANGINA 

BARRONS

 APPEARS.



She looks around the room, squinting in the low in blowing 

dust and particles. Things, objects, plasma globules fly at 

her. She sees...



THE CLOSET. 

THE LIGHT IS THERE

! It is so bright there is no 

looking into it without retinal damage. Great blue-yellow 

shards of light spill into the room, defined by the thick 

atmosphere.



TANGINA



(screaming to be heard)



RYAN! GET DOWNSTAIRS AND WAIT BY 

THE TARGET

!



A heavy section of lamp hurls from the other side of the room 

right for Tangina’s head. Just as it reaches her it slows 

down to a winsome “hover” and falls to the floor at her feet.



TANGINA



(top of her lungs to be 

heard)



STEVEN! GIVE ME THE TENNIS BALL 

MARKED NUMBER ONE

Tangina takes the tennis ball and ducking as other objects 

are coming at her more aggressively... THROWS IT INTO THE 

FURNACE LIGHT OF THE CLOSET!

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



Ryan looks up. There is a flash and immediately a tennis ball 

falls from mid-space and lands on the floor at his feet. He 

picks it up and looks at the inscriptions.



RYAN



(calling upstairs)



It’s my handwriting. It came right 

out of the 

fucking

 air

Diane cannot believe what is going on. She looks back into 

the blizzard.



DIANE



The ball came back! It’s his 

handwriting

Tangina tosses balls #2 and #3 together into the closet 

light.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



There is a mid air flash as ball number two materializes from 

thin air and Ryan catches it. As he inspects the signatures, 

there is another light flash and ball number three follows 

and hits him on the head.

TWO AND THREE CAME BACK! THEY CAME 

BACK

TANGINA



NOW! THE RED RIBBON AT THE CENTER 

OF THE ROPE. HURRY

85.

Steve goes to work on this.



TANGINA



SHE’S JUST AT THE MOUTH OF THE 

CORRIDOR. TELL HER TO STOP! TELL 

HER NOT TO MOVE INTO THE LIGHT

DIANE



(with all her heart)



CAROL ANNE, LISTEN TO ME. DO NOT GO

TURN AWAY FROM IT. DON’T LOOK AT 

IT

!



TANGINA



WHERE IS THE ROPE

!?



Steve hands it to her. Tangina won’t wield it. It is too 

strung out and she is too small.



TANGINA



STEVE, HELP ME WITH THIS

!



Steve enters the blast furnace of energy and wind and takes 

one end of the rope.



TANGINA



THROW IT INTO THE LIGHT

!



He throws in the whip holding onto one end.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



There is another mid flash and the end of rope thrown 

biolcates

 out from between the string and falls in a pile on 

the living room rug. Ryan picks up his end and yells back...



RYAN



GOT IT --

121

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



Tangina and Steve are holding the other end and the red 

ribbon is very close to the closet entrance.



TANGINA



Tell him to take up the slack 

gently. Yell when he sees the 

ribbon.






86.

Tangina is marking inches and feet onto the rope with her 

lipstick, just to their side of the red ribbon. She nods to 

Steve.



TANGINA



I’M LOSING MY VOICE -- SHOUT DOWN 

TO HIM

!!



STEVEN



TAKE UP THE SLACK

!



The ROAD OF WIND inside grows stronger.



TANGINA



HE DIDN’T HEAR YOU

122

Ryan has heard and starts to gently take up the slack. When 

it is taut he is fed the rope one inch at a time.



123

123

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



The flag is disappearing into the VIBRANT LIGHT inside the 

closet. Tangina counts off inches as her lipstick 

calibrations click off into the void.



124

124

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



The flag appears from the air in the center of the string 

opening. The calibrations follow...



RYAN



(screaming)



IT’S THROUGH! IT’S THROUGH

Diane transfers the information.



DIANE

Tangina looks at the last calibration.






87.

TANGINA



ONLY THIRTY-SIX INCHES WIDE, NOT 

MUCH ROOM. HERE, TIE THIS END 

AROUND MY WAIST

.



A look of horror crosses Diane’s face.



DIANE



WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING

?



TANGINA



I’M GOING IN AFTER HER

DIANE



SHE WON’T COME TO YOU. LET ME GO

TANGINA



YOU’VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE

DIANE



NEITHER HAVE YOU

TANGINA



I NEVER WANTED TO! I STILL DON’T

!



Diane steps into the room, blasted back by two several GUSTS 

OF WIND aimed specifically at her.



Steve has already started to tie the rope around his own 

waist. He’s decided to go.



TANGINA



YOU CAN’T. WHO’S GOING TO HOLD THIS 

END

?!



Steve realizes it’s true. Diane pulls the rope from Steve and 

secures it around her waist. Steve ties two clove hitches and 

faces his wife.



DIANE



(above the wind)



I LOVE YOU

!



STEVEN



I LOVE YOU

They kiss, part, and Steve and Tangina get a hold of the end 

of the rope.



Dr. Lesh runs into the storm and helps to hold.






88.

TANGINA



NO, NO! GO DOWN AND HELP RYAN PULL, 

BUT ONLY WHEN I SAY SO! ONLY WHEN I 

SAY

Dr. Lesh runs downstairs and Diane takes one look back at 

Steve.



DIANE



DON’T LET GO, YOU GUYS

STEVEN

ANOTHER ANGLE - CLOSET AND DIANE



She moves into it... the light swallowing her. Tangina 

watches the calibrations and stops feeding when the 

indications are that Diane is in the center of the infinite 

void.

Dr. Lesh runs around in back of Ryan and takes hold of the 

taut rope. They wait without breathing.

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



Tangina is back in her trance. Sweat beads across her brow, 

only to be blown into horizontal rivulets by the eighty miles 

an hour interior wind.



STEVEN



HOW WILL WE KNOW IF SHE’S GOT HER

?



Tangina doesn’t answer... she starts her irregular breathing.



STEVEN



WHEN WILL WE KNOW

?



(he looks back at her)



HEY!



TANGINA

CROSS OVER, CHILDREN! YOU ARE ALL 

WELCOME. ALL WELCOME. GO INTO THE

STEVEN



(wildly betrayed)



YOU SAID NO!! YOU SAID TO STAY OUT

Tangina’s trace doesn’t include Steve. She does not hear him. 

He thinks she is leading his family into the light and 

beyond.



Steve panics and starts to pull the rope back.



STEVEN



DIANE!! CAROL ANNE

!!



Tangina snaps out of her trance to find Steve withdrawing the 

rope with all his might. She lets out a SCREAM.



TANGINA



STEVEN, NOT YET!! RYAN. RYAN, 

PULL

!!



Steve gives one more tug and a flash of electrical energy 

explodes from the closet. A LOW GROWL is heard from the 

light. The GROWL HITS THE LOWER SOUND REGISTERS AND THE 

ENTIRE ROOM SHAKES FROM ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS.

THE FACE OF THE BEAST EMERGES FROM THE CLOSET LIGHT. FACE IS

Steve freezes at the sight and SCREAMS for the first time. He 

drops the rope and...

Ryan takes his cue and pulls. Dozens of electrical discharges 

blossom in midair and there is a primal CRY. A CRY OF BIRTH! 

RYAN AND DR. LESH PULL THE ROPE.



DIANE, HOLDING CAROL ANNE IN HER ARMS, EXPLODES FROM THE AIR 

AND FALLS INTO THE CENTER OF THE LIVING ROOM.

Steve carries Diane who still holds Carol Anne. Both are

They are covered from head to toe in a jellied substance, 

pink and red, that oozes down Steve’s legs to the floor, 

leaving a trail behind.



Steve turns on the water and puts Diane and Carol Anne into 

the tub. Ryan follows him behind with his portable table 

video equipment. The water quickly turns into a bright pink 

as the jelly substance dissolves and foments like 

bubblebath.

The Freelings are moving. 

Bekins

 boxes are stacked all 

around, and packing lists lie on the kitchen counter. The 

entire family has gathered in front of a large roast. E. Buzz 

sits by Robbie. They are bowed in prayer, holding hands.



ALL



Bless us, oh Lord, for these thy 

gifts which we are about to

Rub-a-dub-dub. Thanks for the grub. 

Yeah God!



Everybody LAUGHS. Diane, with an enormous amount of gray in 

her hair, reaches into her purse, almost as an afterthought 

and takes out an envelope addressed to the Freeling family.



DIANE



This came in the mail this morning

Beside her is a good-looking, normal-sized man in his early

Taking the pins from her hair, Diane passes Carol Anne and 

Robbie’s bedroom. The door is closed and warm light filters 

through at the bottom jamb. She listens in, hears nothing and 

starts to turn the knob, but thinks twice and continues into 

her bedroom.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT



Diane has done some redecorating in here. The first thing we 

notice is that the stain is gone and the curtains are lace 

yellow with white for borders. The bedspread is a happy 

sunlit color with smiling moons and planets.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT



Diane comes into the hall in her robe. Her hair is pinned up 

for the tub. The bathwater can be heard inside. Tying off the 

robe, Diane returns to Carol Anne and Robbie’s room and puts 

her hand on the knob. This is hard for her and will always 

be. She turns it and the door slides open. Diane sticks her 

head in tentatively.

 video game. They both turn to see what their 

mother wants.



DIANE



Just

She turns to go and sees that the closet light is off. Diane 

reaches into the closet with her hand... feeling for the 

switch. Her hand flails in the dark until it feels something. 

Diane flinches and pulls. The closet light comes on and Diane 

lets go of the pull cord. She smiles again at her children 

and leaves.

The robe falls in a bundle around her feet. She steps out of 

it and into the tub. Sucking in her breath several times as 

she inches her way into the hot water up to her neck, Diane 

sighs. She closes her eyes. The steam rises to the ceiling. 




95.

The tub water gurgles into the overflow drain just under the 

spigot. Diane takes a 

washrag

, throws it by her feet, and 

uses her big toe to clog the overflow drain to stop the 

annoying sound.

Robbie yawns and climbs into his new bed. Carol Anne imitates

Robbie looks over at the new rocking chair. The old clown 

doll is sitting there quietly. Robbie takes the shirt by his 

bed and tries tossing it over the head of the clown doll but 

he misses. The shirt falls across the arm rest and starts the 

chair rocking. Robbie shrugs and turns out the light by his 

bed. Only the soft moonlight from the window and the warm 

light from the partially opened closet give any ambient 

illumination to the room. Outside the SOUND of a car passing, 

the TICKING of Carol Anne’s new “man in the moon” clock.

The rocking chair is empty.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT



Dressed in her nightgown and robe, Diane combs out her long, 

silky hair. She throws her head forward so all the hair in 

the back can cover her face. Stroking from the back of her 

neck, Diane gets out all the tangles. Satisfied, Diane flips 

her head straight up so all her hair can fly back around her 

shoulders. The shiny gray-brown hair flies straight up into 

the air and upon reaching its full height... it freezes and 

doesn’t come down.



E. Buzz turns and runs out of the room. DIANE IS LOOKING AT 

HERSELF IN THE MIRROR WHEN THIS HAPPENS.

In the background, just above the headboard to her bed, a

Four deep impressions collapse her cheek unevenly against her 

jaw. The left side of her mouth is pressed against her front 

teeth as if someone was attempting to twist her head halfway 

around the left shoulder.



The STAIN STOPS GROWING AND STARTS TO BREATHE, moving in and 

out like the hairy body of a mutant tarantula.

Diane’s lips are pressed flat against her gums and mushed in 

counter-clockwise circles, how a kiss might appear if only 

the receiver were visible.



Her hair is allowed to fall around her shoulder and she 

struggles away from the force that has held her. She goes 

straight for the door. It CLOSES IN HER FACE. Diane turn 

insanely when her arm is nearly wretched from its socket. She 

us flung onto her bed right under the spider stain.

Robbie, sitting up in bed, looks all around for the clown

sight.



Robbie’s breathing quickens. He knows where he now must look. 

After all no child can ever sleep until knowing the night is 

in order. Lying on his stomach, Robbie slowly lowers himself 

head first to the floor of his bed, in preparation to look 

under it. He very, very carefully lifts the dust ruffle and 

lets the top of his head touch the rug. Robbie is upside-down 

as he looks into the darkness under his bed.

UNDER ROBBIE’S BED



The clown is there, face to face with him, smiling 

sardonically.



In the split second it takes for a child to draw a breath and 

let it out through the vocal chords, the clown doll wraps its 

five foot extension arms four times around Robbie’s neck, 

cutting off half his air.

Waking up suddenly. A light interior breeze ruffles her hair. 

Carol Anne sees the closet.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT



Diane lets out a chilling SCREAM. Her robe is torn away from 

her nightgown and hurled into the air. Diane tries to get up 

but a pressure upon her chest defeats her best effort.



CLOSE - DIANE’S BREASTS



The nightgown is suddenly torn away revealing her breast. 

They are kneaded and flattened. Hulking finger impressions 

can be seen sinking deeply into her. Diane’s hysteria doesn’t 

make any difference. Now her legs are spread apart and a 

great pressure over her pelvic bone crushes her deeper and 

deeper into the mattress over and over again.



Diane is fighting all this time when everything suddenly 

stops. She is left for dead, on the wet, sweat-stained 

sheets. Then... it begins again, but this time...



Diane is pulled to her feet. Standing tiptoes above the 

pillows she is DRAGGED UP THE WALL AND ONTO THE CEILING. IN 

DEFIANCE OF EVERY KNOWN LAW OF PHYSICS.



Diane is dragged across the mandibles of the spider stain and 

onto the ceiling. There she is slammed repeatedly, her rear 

end pounding the ceiling, her back arched, her head torn back 

from her shoulders, held invisibly by the hair.



Without a breather, she is then pulled across and down the 

opposite wall. Diane is just as quickly released. She drops 

onto the floor. Like jello are her legs. Diane struggles, 

crawling off the bed to the door, reaching, straining to open 

it.



Mercifully “it” lets her get out. She BELLOWS her children’s 

names.



DIANE



CAROL ANNE! ROBBIE! GET OUT OF 

HERE! RUN! RUN

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT



CLOSE - 

DOORJAM

 TO MASTER BEDROOM



From beneath the door of Diane’s room a rush of 

ECTOPLAMIC

 

SMOKE snakes ahead of her, cutting her off from her 

children’s room. There, it forms an eerie blockade and begins 

to MANIFEST. 




99.

Diane looks up into the face that forms and the hands that 

reach out to her and sees the beginning of the “great beast”. 

She retreats on her rear end backwards down the hall, pursued 

by the phantom twister.

INT. STAIRCASE TO THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



Diane rolls down the carpeted staircase and grapples for her 

footing as she heads down toward the back door.

EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT



It is raining and Diane is instantly soaked as she backs up 

looking at the house SCREAMING.



DIANE



STEVE! ANYONE!! HELP ME

!



Diane’s feet lose her footing in the mud and she falls into 

the shallow end of the unfinished swimming pool, sliding all 

the way down the wet mud to the puddle in the deep end.



THE POOL LIGHTS COME ON. Backlighting the rain and Diane’s 

flopping actions as she regains her balance is the quagmire.



Then, A GUSHING BUBBLE EXPLODES next to her in the mud. She 

stares at it as a second bubble bursts revealing within it, 

the leathery face of a corpse, in its burial clothes, rising 

like a weed straight out of the gushing mud. Diane SCREAMS 

and backs into ANOTHER FACE who’s mouth stretches open 

revealing tiny wire jaw clamps that make popping SOUNDS like 

a 

jew’s

 harp. With a terrible SLURP, the top of a metal 

coffin pushes out of the mud, its lid hinged open, tossing 

bones and dirt and burial jewelry all over Diane.

CLOSE - CAROL ANNE



She is SCREAMING WILDLY. A white hot light erasing her 

features as she once again fights the phantom wind that 

begins to suck the room toward the closet.



CLOSE - ROBBIE



Wrestling on the floor with the clown. He tears the stuffing 

from its middle, shredded bits of white cotton flying at 

terrifying speed toward the closet opening.

CLOSE - THE CLOSET



The closet is becoming a living, terrifying organism as bits 

of flesh grow like moss along the squared off door frame. 

Fatty tissues form, veins escape into the soft pink skin 

until we are looking into a living mouth, all 

gims

 and 

blinding light and at the very back, a pale yellow esophagus 

that spirals to abysmal depths.



154

154

EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT



Some sort of seismic upheaval is forcing dead things up from 

the ground in even greater numbers. Diane is climbing up the 

steep, slick incline toward the metal ladder at the shallow 

end. With every couple of steps to safety, she slips back in 

the rain, turning back to see the black tie crowd that awaits 

her. Diane turns back reaching out her hand to dig in deeper 

when...



ANOTHER HAND GRABS HERS.



Diane shrieks and looks into the face of Ben Tuthill from 

next door.



TUTHILL



Look at that! Look at that!! Look 

in your pool, my God!!



Mrs. Tuthill runs over in her night clothes.



MRS. TUTHILL



Your children. Listen. What sort of 

sound is that?



Ethereally, the SCREAMS from Carol Anne and Robbie sound 

almost angelic in the rain.



DIANE



I HAVE TO GET THEM OUT

!!



She pulls away from Tuthill and races back inside the house. 

Ben starts to follow but then Mrs. Tuthill stops him.



MRS. TUTHILL



Don’t go in there! Don’t ever go in 

there!

INT. STAIRCASE TO UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT



Diane hits the staircase and races up. The door to the 

children’s room is shut and ultra-bright light is streaming 

from under the jamb. Diane opens it and is immediately sucked 

in.



156

156

INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT



Robbie and Carol Anne hold onto their bedposts with all their 

might. Everything is loose and circulating the room a full 

revolution before surrendering to the closet and bottomless 

pit. Diane SCREAMS to her children.



DIANE



TAKE MY HAND, ROBBIE

 -- !



Robbie reaches out with his one hand and Diane tries to work 

her way against the rip to get into position. She looks at 

the closet.



THE CLOSET



It sucks harder and Robbie and Carol Anne’s beds start to 

move toward the hot pink opening. Diane lurches the final 

inch and grabs Robbie’s little wrist with both hands.



DIANE



TAKE YOUR SISTER’S HAND, ROBBIE. 

TAKE IT

!



Robbie reaches for Carol Anne, who reaches out to Robbie. 

They are but inches apart.



ANGLE - CLOSET



One last powerful inhale and the two beds shoot out from 

under the children just as Robbie grabs his sister’s hand and 

Diane pulls them from the room.



157

157

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT



Diane drags her children down the stairs and toward the front 

door. The staircase is rolling as in an earthquake, knocking 

them off balance and onto the landing face down. Diane sees 

the front door through a sudden cut over her left eye. She 

leads the children to it slow in motion as a phenomenally 

intense headwind tries to prevent their escape.

THE RAIN HAS STOPPED.



Teague’s Bronco pulls up to the driveway of the 

Freeling

 

home. Steve gets out, sees the house in turmoil, and runs to 

the front door. Teague gets out of the car, his eyes afloat.

Diane finally reaches the front door. She throws it open and

EXT. ANGLE ON FRONT STEPS - NIGHT



THE FRONT STEPS CRACK OPEN, AND SUDDENLY SOMETHING EXPLODES. 

ONE ORNATE CASKET RISES UP OUT OF THE GROUND SENDING A GEYSER 

OF DIRT AND SPLINTERS INTO THE HOUSE, SHOWERING DIANE, THE 

KIDS, AND STEVE WHO HAS JUST ROUNDED THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT



As the family runs for the side door, the kitchen tile bulges 

horrifically, splits open with a MOAN and two caskets shoot 

into the clean eating area, lids blowing off and rotten, 

rotting corpses reaching out at Diane as they pitch forward. 

As they reach the door, the kitchen wall explodes with the 

impact of the BEAST.

EXT. FREELING HOUSE - SIDE - NIGHT



Diane, carrying Carol Anne, and Robbie come running from the

He turns as a coffin launches out of the lawn ripping up 

wires and cables and causing electrical shorts and flashes 

all around it. 




104.

It flies open and a hideous corpse lurches across the 

sidewalk at Teague. He falls backwards into a hole, the 

corpse landing on top of him.



Teague tries to scream but only night breath gushes out.

As the Freeling car passes the house, a coffin explodes from 

under Tuthill’s 

VW

 knocking it out into the street. Steve 

swerves but cannot avoid hitting the 

VW

on it’s top. Steve fights for control of the car.

The car continues past a fire hydrant. Another casket bursts 

out of the ground, sending mud and water 30 feet into the 

air. Steve slams on the brakes, stopping inches from the 

coffin and mud that block their path. Steve jumps out to 

clear the path. An incredible noise blasts forth from down 

the street. He turns...

STEVE’S POV



The children’s window is glowing with an almost radioactive

The entire hose starts to suck inward, imploding at an angle

The street is in chaos. Neighbors are streaming from their

Coffins and corpses lie everywhere. The Freeling car turns a

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF CAR - LOW ANGLE - NIGHT



The street cracks wide open and an old wooden coffin is

through the rain and wind at Steve.



SCREAMING WELLS UP inside. Steve throws the car into reverse.

The ground opens up trapping the car on a narrow island. Five

Carol Anne is fiddling with the RCA
